\begin{abstract}
  Exciting, mind-blowing abstract.  Keep things short and simple, but
  describe everything interesting in the paper.  Give context for the
  work briefly, but don't use citations within the abstract.  Also,
  this is the one place where passive voice is preferred; don't say
  things like ``we do this''.  (That goes double for single-author
  papers.)  Instead, say things like ``it is shown that this paper is
  awesome and its authors totally rock.''  Go easy on abbreviations;
  unless you need to use an abbreviation multiple times in the
  abstract, wait to introduce it until the body of the paper.  Most
  importantly, be sure to advertise any new or important techniques
  and explain the conclusions of the paper.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:Introduction}

Some really cool introduction, explaining the context of this work,
why it needs to be done, how it will change the world, etc.  Grab the
reader's attention so s/he cares enough to keep reading.  Cite
appropriate sources~\cite{MTW, Wald:1984} for the context, including
any other approaches to this particular
problem~\cite{doranlasenby:2003}.

Explain how this paper attacks that problem (and why other approaches
need to be improved, if relevant).  Summarize everything that is done
in the paper, including the conclusions.  The introduction should sort
of be a mini version of the whole paper, without going into all the
details, because most readers will only get this far.

Don't be afraid of giving away the punchline here---this paper isn't a
story with dramatic twists and turns; it's meant to communicate the
ideas effectively.  Aristotle supposedly advised: ``tell them what you
are going to tell them, tell them, then tell them what you told
them.''  That should describe the structure of the paper, and even of
sections within the paper.  Don't let readers get lost wondering why
you're going through all these steps.  But try to balance that with
not repeating things too much.  For example, in the introduction,
explain at a broad level what you're going to do in
Sec.~\ref{sec:AnotherCleverOne}.  Then, at the beginning of
Sec.~\ref{sec:AnotherCleverOne}, go into more detail so that someone
can get an idea of what that section's task is and how you accomplish
the task of that section without reading through the whole thing.  At
the end of that section, briefly recap the point, to show your reader
that you actually had one.

Try to make the paper as modular as possible.  People will skip
sections, so if the motivation for Sec.~\ref{sec:AnotherCleverOne} is
contained in Sec.~\ref{sec:BrilliantSection}, don't assume the reader
saw that, understood it, or remembers it.  But again, try to minimize
repetition; if necessary, just refer to the other section with a brief
sentence or paragraph explaining the important point.  Also, begin and
end each section with a brief segue to/from the neighboring section;
don't present the paper as a series of disconnected ideas.

    \CapName{Caption title} Caption content. Pay a lot of attention to
    figures and captions.  Most people will skim the figures when
    trying to decide whether this paper is worth reading and
    remembering, so make every figure count.  Make the figures, axis
    labels, and captions clear and self-contained, because the reader
    will not have read the relevant text.  Also, make sure font sizes
    are comparable to the font sizes in the caption, so that things
    are readable. %

\section{Brilliant section title}
\label{sec:BrilliantSection}
In this section, we use garblehobber midimuxers to show that
floobleflakkers have warlywursters.  This will be crucial to
understanding the emission of gamma rays by hockledockers in
Sec.~\ref{sec:AnotherCleverOne}.

\subsection{Subsection with \texorpdfstring{$\Sigma$}{Sigma}
  math in the title}
\label{sec:ImportantSubsection}

Use \verb|\texorpdfstring| to get rid of compiler warnings when pdf
bookmarks would complain about having math in the text of section
titles.

\subsection{More important subsection}
\label{sec:MoreImportantSubsection}
Never have just one subsection.  That would be dumb.

\section{Another clever title}
\label{sec:AnotherCleverOne}
In Sec.~\ref{sec:BrilliantSection}, we showed that floobleflakkers
have warlywursters.  By convolving with the spectrum of sturlywurlers,
we can understand why the spectral index of hockledockers is $-3.5$.

Lots of gibberish will be found here.

Because the PSD of sturlywurlers goes as $f^{-1.75}$, and because
gamma-ray emission is independently flabbergasted, we see that
hockledockers must have a spectral index of $-3.5$.

\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:Conclusions}
Summarize what has happened in this paper, and how it will change the
world.  Look forward to future work that needs to be done on this.

\section{Grubby details that are really too long for the body but are
  important from a scientific standpoint}
\label{sec:GrubbyDetails}

If some poor grad student wants to implement your methods ten years
from now, or understand some long proof, the information needs to be
contained in the paper.  But putting everything in the body of the
paper would be asking people to read the boring stuff, and they'd fall
asleep.  Hence appendices.  No one bothers to read this stuff unless
they really need to, so no one falls asleep.

Also consider attaching code in ancillary files (on the arXiv) and/or
supplements (in most journals).  This is good for science and good for
your career.
