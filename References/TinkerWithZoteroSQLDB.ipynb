As the initial conditions, BH-NS binaries in a quasiequilibrium state are prepared in a modified version of the moving-puncture approach. The BH is modeled by a nonspinning moving puncture and for the NS, a polytropic equation of state with $\\\\Gamma=2$ and the irrotational velocity field are employed. The mass ratio of the BH to the NS, $Q=M_{\\\\rm BH}/M_{\\\\rm NS}$, is chosen in the range between 1.5 and 5.

For a large value of $Q$ for which the NS is not tidally disrupted and is simply swallowed by the BH, gravitational waves are characterized by inspiral, merger, and ringdown waveforms. In this case, the waveforms are qualitatively the same as that from BH-BH binaries. For a sufficiently small value of $Q \\\\alt 2$, the NS may be tidally disrupted before it is swallowed by the BH. In this case, the amplitude of the merger and ringdown waveforms is very low, and thus, gravitational waves are characterized by the inspiral waveform and subsequent quick damping. The difference in the merger and ringdown waveforms is clearly reflected in the spectrum shape and in the ``cut-off'' frequency above which the spectrum amplitude steeply decreases. When an NS is not tidally disrupted (e.g., for Q=5), kick velocity, induced by asymmetric gravitational wave emission, agrees approximately with that derived for the merger of BH-BH binaries, whereas for the case that the tidal disruption occurs, the kick velocity is significantly suppressed.\"), (32, '2009-02-04 21:35:17'), (33, 'Gravitational waves from black hole-neutron star binaries I'), (34, '0902.0416 PDF'), (35, 'http://www.arxiv.org/pdf/0902.0416.pdf'), (36, '2009-02-04 21:35:18'), (37, 'Searching for binary coalescences with inspiral templates: Detection and parameter estimation'), (38, 'http://arxiv.org/abs/0902.0307'), (39, '0902.0307'), (40, 'There has been remarkable progress in numerical relativity recently.

It should be emphasized, however, that in a typical evolution scenario there is a considerable time window in which the signal is no longer dominated by the black-hole quasinormal modes, but the leading order power-law tail has not yet taken over. Higher-order terms may have a considerable contribution to the signal at these intermediate times. It is therefore of interest to analyze these higher-order corrections to the leading-order power-law behavior.

Typically, the equations are three-dimensionally covariant, elliptic, and linear in the kinematical functions (the lapse function and shift vector) that they determine. The gravitational field enters in nonlinear form through the presence of curvature in the equations. We present a flat-space model of such elliptic equations (e.g. for maximal slicing) which suggests that this curvature leads to an exponential decrease in the proper time between time slices at late times. We show how the use of maximal slicing with minimal-distortion observers generalizes the notion of a stationary rest frame to dynamical asymptotically flat spacetimes. In cosmological spacetimes the use of minimum-distortion observers is shown to differentiate between those universes which contain only kinematic time dependence (e.g. open Kasner universe) and those in which dynamical degrees of freedom are present (e.g. mixmaster universe). We examine many examples and construct new coordinate systems in both asymptotically flat and cosmological solutions to illustrate these properties.'), (98, 'PROLA'), (99, '2009-02-15 20:03:24'), (100, 'PROLA Full Text PDF'), (101, 'http://prola.aps.org/pdf/PRD/v17/i10/p2529_1'), (102, '2009-02-15 20:03:25'), (103, 'Nonlinear gravitational-wave memory from binary black hole mergers'), (104, '2009-02-23 2009-02-23'), (105, 'http://arxiv.org/abs/0902.3660'), (106, '0902.3660'), (107, 'On Toroidal Horizons in Binary Black Hole Inspirals'), (108, '2011-10-07 2011-10-07'), (109, '0902.3660 PDF'), (110, 'http://www.arxiv.org/pdf/0902.3660.pdf'), (111, '2009-02-25 18:36:20'), (112, 'Momentum Flow in Black Hole Binaries: I.

We investigate the ability of several search pipelines to detect gravitational waves from compact binaries with spin.

This challenges the paradigm that most galaxies form through hierarchical mergers, yet retain supermassive black holes at their centers despite having escape velocities much less than v_max. Interaction with a circumbinary disk can align the binary black hole spins with their orbital angular momentum, reducing the recoil velocity of the final black hole produced in the subsequent merger. However, the effectiveness of this alignment depends on highly uncertain accretion flows near the binary black holes. In this Letter, we show that if the spin S_1 of the more massive binary black hole is even partially aligned with the orbital angular momentum L, relativistic spin precession on sub-parsec scales can align the binary black hole spins with each other. This alignment significantly reduces the recoil velocity even in the absence of gas. For example, if the angle between S_1 and L at large separations is 10 degrees while the second spin S_2 is isotropically distributed, the spin alignment discussed in this paper reduces the median recoil from 864 km/s to 273 km/s for maximally spinning black holes with a mass ratio of 9/11.

At present, lack of resolution far from the binary prevents an accurate estimate of the energy emitted, though a rough calculation suggests on the order of 5% of the initial rest mass of the system is radiated as gravitational waves during the final orbit and ringdown.'), (512, '2009-10-29 15:34:17'), (513, '10 - Elastostatics'), (514, '11 - Elastodynamics'), (515, 'http://prola.aps.org.proxy.library.cornell.edu/pdf/PRL/v95/i12/e121101'), (516, '13 - Vorticity'), (517, '14 - Turbulence'), (518, '2009-10-29 15:34:19'), (519, 'Inspiral, merger, and ring-down of equal-mass black-hole binaries'), (520, '17 - Convection'), (521, '18 - Magnetohydrodynamics'), (522, '2007-06-15 June 15, 2007'), (523, '124018-42'), (524, 'http://link.aps.org/abstract/PRD/v75/e124018'), (525, '10.1103/PhysRevD.75.124018'), (526, '2009-10-29 15:40:23'), (527, '1002.2643'), (528, 'The inspiral of binary black holes is governed by gravitational radiation reaction at binary separations r < 1000 M, yet it is too computationally expensive to begin numerical-relativity simulations with initial separations r > 10 M.

We examine how this post-Newtonian evolution affects the distribution of spin orientations at separations r ~ 10 M where numerical-relativity simulations typically begin. Although isotropic spin distributions at r ~ 1000 M remain isotropic at r ~ 10 M, distributions that are initially partially aligned with the orbital angular momentum can be significantly distorted during the post-Newtonian inspiral. Spin precession tends to align (anti-align) the binary black hole spins with each other if the spin of the more massive black hole is initially partially aligned (anti-aligned) with the orbital angular momentum, thus increasing (decreasing) the average final spin. Spin precession is stronger for comparable-mass binaries, and could produce significant spin alignment before merger for both supermassive and stellar-mass black hole binaries.

The memory is also potentially detectable in binary black hole mergers. While the oscillatory pieces of the gravitational-wave polarizations for quasi-circular, inspiralling compact binaries have been computed to 3PN order, the memory contribution to the polarizations has only been calculated to leading-order (the next-to-leading order 0.5PN term has previously been shown to vanish).

We examine the overlaps of these models with one another and with the prototype effective one-body model (calibrated to numerical relativity simulations, as currently used by initial LIGO) for a number of different binaries at 2PN, 3PN and 3.5PN orders to quantify their differences and to help us decide whether there exist preferred families that are the most appropriate as search templates. We conclude that as long as the total mass remains less than a certain upper limit M_crit, all template families at 3.5PN order (except TaylorT3 and TaylorEt) are equally good for the purpose of detection.

It is precisely this foreground which would enable high-precision cosmology. BBO would determine the luminosity distance to each binary to ~percent accuracy. BBO's angular resolution would be sufficient to uniquely identify the host galaxy for most binaries; a coordinated optical/infrared observing campaign could obtain the redshifts. Combining the GW-derived distances and EM-derived redshifts for such a large sample of objects leads to extraordinarily tight constraints on cosmological parameters.

The agreement for prograde orbits and large spin values of the Kerr black-hole can be further improved at high velocities by properly factoring out the lower-order post-Newtonian contributions in ρℓm.

Fundamental bias can cause systematic errors in the detection and parameter estimation of signals, which can lead to a mischaracterization of the universe through incorrect inferences about source event rates and populations. We propose a remedy through the introduction of the parameterized post-Einsteinian framework, which consists of the enhancement of waveform templates via the inclusion of post-Einsteinian parameters. These parameters would ostensibly be designed to interpolate between templates constructed in general relativity and well-motivated alternative theories of gravity, and also include extrapolations that follow sound theoretical principles, such as consistency with conservation laws and symmetries. As an example, we construct parameterized post-Einsteinian templates for the binary coalescence of equal-mass, non-spinning compact objects in a quasi-circular inspiral.

After developing new techniques to accommodate the peculiarities of cultural data, we were able to infer an ancestral region (Fiji) and a sequence of cultural origins for these Polynesian societies. In addition, we found evidence of cultural exchange, migration and a serial founder effect. Results were stronger when analyses were based on functional traits (presumably subject to natural selection and convergence) rather than symbolic or stylistic traits (probably subject to cultural selection for rapid divergence).

The existence of gravitational radiation was first predicted by Einstein in 1916, however gravitational waves have not yet been directly observed. One source of gravitation radiation is binary inspiral. Two compact bodies orbiting each other, such as a pair of black holes, lose energy to gravitational radiation. As the system loses energy the bodies spiral towards each other. This causes their orbital speed and the amount of gravitational radiation to increase, producing a characteristic ``chirp'' waveform in the LIGO sensitive band. In this thesis, matched filtering of LIGO science data is used to search for low mass binary systems in the halo of dark matter surrounding the Milky Way. Observations of gravitational microlensing events of stars in the Large Magellanic Cloud suggest that some fraction of the dark matter in the halo may be in the form of Massive Astrophysical Compact Halo Objects (MACHOs). It has been proposed that low mass black holes formed in the early universe may be a component of the MACHO population; some fraction of these black hole MACHOs will be in binary systems and detectable by LIGO. The inspiral from a MACHO binary composed of two 0.5 solar mass black holes enters the LIGO sensitive band around 40 Hz. The chirp signal increases in amplitude and frequency, sweeping through the sensitive band to 4400 Hz in 140 seconds.

We cast the Einstein equations into the form of a flat-spacetime wave equation together with a harmonic gauge condition, and solve it formally as a retarded integral over the past null cone of the chosen field point. The part of this integral that involves the matter sources and the near-zone gravitational field is evaluated in terms of multipole moments using standard techniques; the remainder of the retarded integral, extending over the radiation zone, is evaluated in a novel way. The result is a manifestly convergent and finite procedure for calculating gravitational radiation to arbitrary orders in a post-Newtonian expansion. Through second post-Newtonian order, the radiation is also shown to propagate toward the observer along true null rays of the asymptotically Schwarzschild spacetime, despite having been derived using flat-spacetime wave equations. The method cures defects that plagued previous \"brute-force\" slow-motion approaches to the generation of gravitational radiation, and yields results that agree perfectly with those recently obtained by a mixed post-Minkowskian post-Newtonian method.

It is therefore important to address how accurately LISA can measure the source parameters and explore the implications for astronomy and cosmology. Present observations and theoretical models suggest that massive black holes could be spinning, possibly rapidly in some cases. In binary systems, the relativistic spin-orbit interaction causes the orbital plane to precess in space, producing a characteristic signature on the emitted gravitational waves. In this paper we investigate the effect of spins on the gravitational wave signal registered at the LISA output—we provide ready-to-use analytical expressions of the measured signal—and the implications for parameter estimation. We consider the inspiral phase of binary systems in circular orbit undergoing the so-called “simple precession” and we approximate the gravitational radiation at the restricted post1.5-Newtonian order. We show that the presence of spins changes dramatically the signature of the signal recorded by LISA. As a consequence, the mean square errors associated with the parameter measurements are significantly smaller than the ones obtained when the effect of spins is neglected. For a binary system of two 106M⊙ black holes, the angular resolution and the relative error on the luminosity distance improve by a factor of ≈3–10; the fractional errors on the chirp mass and the reduced mass decrease by a factor of ∼10 and ∼103, respectively.'), (1749, '2010-07-14 21:50:19'), (1750, 'http://prd.aps.org/pdf/PRD/v70/i4/e042001'), (1751, '2010-07-14 21:50:21'), (1752, 'Measuring coalescing massive binary black holes with gravitational waves: The impact of spin-induced precession'), (1753, 122001), (1754, '2006-12-01 December 01, 2006'), (1755, 'http://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevD.74.122001'), (1756, '10.1103/PhysRevD.74.122001'), (1757, 'The coalescence of massive black holes generates gravitational waves (GWs) that will be measurable by space-based detectors such as LISA to large redshifts.

Following pioneering work by Vecchio, we examine the impact upon GW measurements of including these precession-induced modulations in the waveform model. We find that the additional periodicity due to spin precession breaks degeneracies among certain parameters, greatly improving the accuracy with which they may be measured. In particular, mass measurements are improved tremendously, by one to several orders of magnitude.

Though not a drastic improvement relative to analyses which neglect spin precession, even modest gains in source localization will greatly facilitate searches for electromagnetic counterparts to GW events. Determination of distance to the source is likewise improved: We find that relative error in measured luminosity distance is commonly ∼0.1%–0.4% at z∼1.

Signals from coalescing binaries will most probably not stand above the broadband noise of the detector. Their detection is possible by the use of special data analysis techniques such as matched filtering which takes advantage of the fact that the wave form can be fairly well predicted. The wave form of the coalescing binary signal is known very accurately. However, the parameters of the signal are not known priori and the signal needs to be correlated with several filters which are copies of the coalescing binary wave form for different values of the parameters. In this paper we present an algorithm to choose a lattice set of filters by a criterion that every signal of a certain minimal strength is picked up by at least one filter of the set. The wave form is characterized by three parameters: the time of arrival, the mass parameter, and the phase of the signal. We show that it is enough to have just two filters corresponding to the phase of the signal. Determination of the lattice for various values of the mass parameter involves a knowledge of the cross correlation function of two chirp wave forms with different values of the parameters. It is shown that for a considerable range of the mass parameter, the peak value of the correlation function, in a certain approximation, does not depend on the absolute values of the parameters but only on their difference. This leads to a very convenient way of constructing most of the lattice. The maximum possible distance up to which we can see is restricted by the threshold of the detector. There is a further limitation on this distance brought about by the fact that we can use only a finite number of filters. The number of filters which one can use depends on the available computing power. Hence, there is an empirical relation between computing power and the distance up to which we can see. In a restricted sense, the computing power decides the number of detectable events.

Numerical simulations of such systems require suitable initial data. In this paper, we examine three methods of constructing binary-black-hole initial data, focusing on their ability to generate black holes with nearly extremal spins: (i) Bowen-York initial data, including standard puncture data (based on conformal flatness and Bowen-York extrinsic curvature), (ii) standard quasiequilibrium initial data (based on the extended-conformal-thin-sandwich equations, conformal flatness, and maximal slicing), and (iii) quasiequilibrium data based on the superposition of Kerr-Schild metrics. We find that the two conformally flat methods (i) and (ii) perform similarly, with spins up to about 0.99 obtainable at the initial time. However, in an evolution, we expect the spin to quickly relax to a significantly smaller value around 0.93 as the initial geometry relaxes. For quasiequilibrium superposed Kerr-Schild data [method (iii)], we construct initial data with initial spins as large as 0.9997. We evolve superposed Kerr-Schild data sets with spins of 0.93 and 0.97 and find that the spin drops by only a few parts in 104 during the initial relaxation; therefore, we expect that superposed Kerr-Schild initial data will allow evolutions of binary black holes with relaxed spins above 0.99. Along the way to these conclusions, we also present several secondary results: the power-law coefficients with which the spin of puncture initial data approaches its maximal possible value; approximate analytic solutions for large spin puncture data; embedding diagrams for single spinning black holes in methods (i) and (ii); nonunique solutions for method (ii). All of the initial-data sets that we construct contain subextremal black holes, and when we are able to push the spin of the excision boundary surface into the superextremal regime, the excision surface is always enclosed by a second, subextremal apparent horizon. The quasilocal spin is measured by using approximate rotational Killing vectors, and the spin is also inferred from the extrema of the intrinsic scalar curvature of the apparent horizon.

As a start toward assessing the full capabilities of the LIGO-VIRGO detector network, we investigate the sensitivity of individual LIGO-VIRGO-like interferometers and the precision with which they can determine the characteristics of an inspiralling binary system. Since the two interferometers of the LIGO detector share nearly the same orientation, their joint sensitivity is similar to that of a single, more sensitive interferometer. We express our results for a single interferometer of both initial and advanced LIGO design, and also for the LIGO detector in the limit that its two interferometers share exactly the same orientation. We approximate the secular evolution of a binary system as driven exclusively by its leading-order quadrupole gravitational radiation. Observations of a binary in a single interferometer are described by four characteristic quantities: an amplitude A, a chirp mass M, a time T, and a phase ψ. We find the amplitude signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) ρ of an observed binary system as a function of A and M for a particular orientation of the binary with respect to the interferometer, and also the distribution of SNR's for randomly oriented binaries at a constant distance. To assess the interferometer sensitivity, we calculate the rate at which sources are expected to be observed and the range to which they are observable. Assuming a conservative rate density for coalescing neutron-star binary systems of 8×10-8 yr-1 Mpc-3, we find that the advanced LIGO detector will observe approximately 69 yr-1 with an amplitude SNR greater than 8. Of these, approximately 7 yr-1 will be from binaries at distances greater than 950 Mpc. We give analytic and numerical results for the precision with which each of the characteristic quantities can be determined by interferometer observations. For neutron-star binaries, the fractional 1σ statistical error in the determination of A is equal to 1/ρ. For ρ>8, the fractional 1σ error in the measurement of M in the advanced LIGO detectors is less than 2×10-5, a phenomenal precision. The characteristic time is related to the moment when coalescence occurs, and can be measured in the advanced detectors with a 1σ uncertainty of less than 3×10-4 s (assuming ρ>8). We also explore the sensitivity of these results to a tunable parameter in the interferometer design (the recycling frequency). The optimum choice of the parameter is dependent on the goal of the observations, e.g., maximizing the rate of detections or maximizing the precision of measurement. We determine the optimum parameter values for these two cases. The calculations leading to the SNR and the precision of measurement assume that the interferometer observations extend over only the last several minutes of binary inspiral, during which time the orbital frequency increases from approximately 5 Hz to 500 Hz. We examine the sensitivity of our results to the elapsed time of the observation and show that observations of longer duration lead to very little improvement in the SNR or the precision of measurement.\"), (2456, '2011-01-28 20:47:58'), (2457, 'Observing binary inspiral in gravitational radiation'), (2458, 'http://prd.aps.org/pdf/PRD/v47/i6/p2198_1'), (2459, '2011-01-28 20:48:00'), (2460, 'Detection, measurement, and gravitational radiation'), (2461, 46), (2462, 5236), (2463, '1992-12-15 December 15, 1992'), (2464, 'http://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevD.46.5236'), (2465, '10.1103/PhysRevD.46.5236'), (2466, 'The optimum design, construction, and use of the Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory (LIGO), the French-Italian Gravitational Wave Observatory (VIRGO), or the Laser Gravitational Wave Observatory (LAGOS) gravitational radiation detectors depends upon accurate calculations of their sensitivity to different sources of radiation. Here I examine how to determine the sensitivity of these instruments to sources of gravitational radiation by considering the process by which data are analyzed in a noisy detector. The problem of detection (is a signal present in the output of the detector?) is separated from that of measurement (what are the parameters that characterize the signal in the detector output?). By constructing the probability that the detector output is consistent with the presence of a signal, I show how to quantify the uncertainty that the output contains a signal and is not simply noise. Proceeding further, I construct the probability distribution that the parametrization μ that characterizes the signal has a certain value. From the distribution and its mode I determine volumes V(P) in parameter space such that μ∈V(P) with probability P [owing to the random nature of the detector noise, the volumes V(P) are always different, even for identical signals in the detector output], thus quantifying the uncertainty in the estimation of the signal parametrization. These techniques are suitable for analyzing the output of a noisy detector. If we are designing a detector, or determining the suitability of an existing detector for observing a new source, then we do not have detector output to analyze but are interested in the \"most likely\" response of the detector to a signal. I exploit the techniques just described to determine the \"most likely\" volumes V(P) for detector output that would result in a parameter probability distribution with given mode.

Recent theorems have shown that, at least in an adiabatic evolution, such orbits evolve from one circular configuration into another, changing only their radius and inclination angle. This constrains the system's evolution in such a way that the change in its Carter constant can be deduced from knowledge of gravitational wave fluxes propagating to infinity and down the black hole's horizon. Thus, in this particular case, a local radiation reaction force is not needed. In accordance with post-Newtonian weak-field predictions, we find that inclined orbits radiatively evolve to larger inclination angles (although the post-Newtonian prediction overestimates the rate of this evolution in the strong field by a factor $\\\\lesssim 3$).

The agreement for prograde orbits and large spin values of the Kerr black hole can be further improved at high velocities by properly factoring out the lower-order post-Newtonian contributions in \\\\rho_{l m}. The resummation procedure results in a better and systematic agreement between numerical and analytical amplitudes (and energy fluxes) than standard Taylor-expanded post-Newtonian approximants. This is particularly true for higher-order modes, such as (2,1), (3,3), (3,2), and (4,4) for which less spin post-Newtonian terms are known. We also extend the factorized resummation of multipolar amplitudes to generic mass-ratio, non-precessing, spinning black holes. Lastly, in our study we employ new, recently computed, higher-order post-Newtonian terms in several subdominant modes, and compute explicit expressions for the half and one-and-half post-Newtonian contributions to the odd-parity (current) and even-parity (odd) multipoles, respectively.

Moreover, we find that, for both initial and advanced detectors, the two closed-form frequency-domain models fail to satisfy the minimal required accuracy standard in a very large domain of the two-dimensional parameter space.

Moreover, adding a pole to the flux seems unnecessary in the construction of these Padé-approximated flux formulas. Padé approximants may be useful in suggesting the form of fitting formulas. We compare a 15-orbit numerical waveform of the Caltech-Cornell group to the suggested Padé waveforms of Damour et al. in the equal mass, nonspinning quasicircular case. The comparison suggests that the Padé waveforms do not agree better with the numerical waveform than the standard Taylor based waveforms.

Our treatment is based on the 3PN Hamiltonian of Jaranowski and Schäfer. One of the new methods we introduce is based on the consideration of the (invariant) function linking the angular momentum and the angular frequency. We also generalize the “effective one-body” approach of Buonanno and Damour by introducing a non-minimal (i.e. “non-geodesic”) effective dynamics at the 3PN level. We find that the location of the LSO sensitively depends on the (currently unknown) value of the dimensionless quantity ωstatic which parametrizes a certain regularization ambiguity of the 3PN dynamics. We find, however, that all the analytical methods we use numerically agree among themselves if the value of this parameter is ωstatic≃-9. This suggests that the correct value of ωstatic is near -9 [the precise value ωstatic*≡-47/3+(41/64)π2=-9.3439… seems to play a special role]. If this is the case, we then show how to further improve the analytical determination of various LSO quantities by using a “Shanks” transformation to accelerate the convergence of the successive (already resummed) PN estimates.'), (2687, '2011-02-16 19:53:58'), (2688, 'http://prd.aps.org.proxy.library.cornell.edu/pdf/PRD/v62/i8/e084011'), (2689, '2011-02-16 19:54:00'), (2690, 'Coalescence of two spinning black holes: An effective one-body approach'), (2691, 124013), (2692, '2001-11-27 November 27, 2001'), (2693, 'http://link.aps.org.proxy.library.cornell.edu/doi/10.1103/PhysRevD.64.124013'), (2694, '10.1103/PhysRevD.64.124013'), (2695, 'We generalize to the case of spinning black holes a recently introduced “effective one-body” approach to the general relativistic dynamics of binary systems.

The combination of the effective one-body approach, and of a Padé definition of the crucial effective radial functions, is shown to define a dynamics with much improved post-Newtonian convergence properties, even for black hole separations of the order of 6 GM/c2. The complete (conservative) phase-space evolution equations of binary spinning black hole systems are written down and their exact and approximate first integrals are discussed. This leads to the approximate existence of a two-parameter family of “spherical orbits” (with constant radius), and of a corresponding one-parameter family of “last stable spherical orbits” (LSSO). These orbits are of special interest for forthcoming LIGO-VIRGO-GEO gravitational wave observations. The binding energy and total angular momentum of LSSO’s are studied in some detail. It is argued that for most (but not all) of the parameter space of two spinning holes the approximate (leading-order) effective one-body approach introduced here gives a reliable analytical tool for describing the dynamics of the last orbits before coalescence. This tool predicts, in a quantitative way, how certain spin orientations increase the binding energy of the LSSO. This leads to a detection bias, in LIGO-VIRGO-GEO observations, favoring spinning black hole systems, and makes it urgent to complete the conservative effective one-body dynamics given here by adding (resummed) radiation reaction effects, and by constructing gravitational waveform templates that include spin effects.

Here I generalize the gauge-invariant ISCO condition of Blanchet & Iyer (2003) to the case of spinning (nonprecessing) binaries. The Blanchet-Iyer ISCO condition has two desirable and unexpected properties: (1) it exactly reproduces the Schwarzschild ISCO in the test-mass limit, and (2) it accurately approximates the recently-calculated shift in the Schwarzschild ISCO frequency due to the conservative-piece of the gravitational self-force [Barack & Sago (2009)]. The generalization of this ISCO condition to spinning binaries has the property that it also exactly reproduces the Kerr ISCO in the test-mass limit (up to the order at which PN spin corrections are currently known). The shift in the ISCO due to the spin of the test-particle is also calculated. Remarkably, the gauge-invariant PN ISCO condition exactly reproduces the ISCO shift predicted by the Papapetrou equations for a fully-relativistic spinning particle. It is surprising that an analysis of the stability of the standard PN equations of motion is able (without any form of \"resummation\") to accurately describe strong-field effects of the Kerr spacetime. The ISCO frequency shift due to the conservative self-force in Kerr is also calculated from this new ISCO condition, as well as from the effective-one-body Hamiltonian of Barausse & Buonanno (2010).

These search templates will be a discrete subset of a continuous, multiparameter family, each of which approximates a possible signal. The search might be performed hierarchically, with a first pass through the data using a low threshold and a coarsely spaced, few-parameter template set, followed by a second pass on threshold-exceeding data segments, with a higher threshold and a more finely spaced template set that might have a larger number of parameters. Alternatively, the search might involve a single pass through the data using the larger threshold and finer template set. This paper extends and generalizes the Sathyaprakash-Dhurandhar (SD) formalism for choosing the discrete, finely spaced template set used in the final (or sole) pass through the data, based on the analysis of a single interferometer. The SD formalism is rephrased in geometric language by introducing a metric on the continuous template space from which the discrete template set is drawn. This template metric is used to compute the loss of signal-to-noise ratio and reduction of event rate which result from the coarseness of the template grid. Correspondingly, the template spacing and total number N of templates are expressed, via the metric, as functions of the reduction in event rate. The theory is developed for a template family of arbitrary dimensionality (whereas the original SD formalism was restricted to a single nontrivial dimension). The theory is then applied to a simple post1-Newtonian template family with two nontrivial dimensions. For this family, the number of templates N in the finely spaced grid is related to the spacing-induced fractional loss L of event rate and to the minimum mass Mmin of the least massive star in the binaries for which one searches by N∼2×105(0.1/L)(0.2M⊙/Mmin)2.7 for the first LIGO interferometers and by N∼8×106(0.1/L)(0.2M⊙/Mmin)2.7 for advanced LIGO interferometers. This is several orders of magnitude greater than one might have expected based on Sathyaprakash’s discovery of a near degeneracy in the parameter space, the discrepancy being due to that paper’s high choice of Mmin and less stringent choice of L.

A post-Newtonian model for the error of these numerical simulations suggests that adaptive mesh refinement coupled with second-order accurate finite difference codes will not be able to robustly obtain the accuracy required for reliable gravitational wave extraction on Terabyte-scale computers. I conclude that higher-order methods (higher-order finite difference methods and/or spectral methods) combined with adaptive mesh refinement and/or multipatch technology will be needed for robustly accurate gravitational wave extraction from numerical relativity calculations of binary coalescence scenarios.'), (2836, '2011-03-09 23:29:22'), (2837, 'http://prd.aps.org/pdf/PRD/v71/i10/e104016'), (2838, '2011-03-09 23:29:24'), (2839, \"Measuring gravitational waves from binary black hole coalescences.

Our results are (i) if numerical relativity simulations have not produced template merger waveforms before BBH events are detected, one can study the merger waves using simple band-pass filters. For BBHs smaller than about 40M⊙ detected via their inspiral waves, the band-pass filtering signal-to-noise ratio indicates that the merger waves should typically be just barely visible in the noise for initial and advanced LIGO interferometers. (ii) We derive an optimized maximum-likelihood method for extracting a best-fit merger waveform from the noisy detector output; one “perpendicularly projects” this output onto a function space (specified using wavelets) that incorporates our (possibly sketchy) prior knowledge of the waveforms. An extension of the method allows one to extract the BBH’s two independent waveforms from outputs of several interferometers.

Their reality can be interpreted as evidence of supermassive black-hole encounters in a previous aeon, as predicted by conformal cyclic cosmology (CCC) [2]. Counter arguments [4-6] pointed out that such circles arise, at similar frequency, also in simulated data using WMAP's CMB power spectrum, plus random input. We responded [7] that if such circles contribute to CMB, this influences the power spectrum, enhancing such circles in simulations. We confirm this here, but show that if the theoretical LCDM power spectrum is used instead, then the low-variance circles disappear. This is evidence that the LCDM model gives an incomplete explanation of the CMB, missing crucial information, which is provided by incorporating low-variance circles of CCC. The excellent agreement between theoretical LCDM and observed power spectrum, even for fairly large l-values, does not reveal this discrepancy, of relevance only at larger l-values where agreement is weak. We point out various non-random aspects of the circles, seen both in the true data and in simulations with WMAP power spectrum, but not with the theoretical LCDM spectrum. We also show the spatial distribution of concentric circle sets to be very non-random in the true WMAP data (perhaps owing to large-scale mass inhomogeneities distorting CCC's circle shapes), in complete contrast with simulations with WMAP power spectrum, where such circle sets are much sparser and closer to average temperature.

Further, using a prescription that smoothly connects the plunge phase to a perturbed single black hole, we obtain an estimate for the total recoil associated with the binary black hole coalescence. We show that the crucial physical feature which determines the magnitude of the terminal recoil is the presence of a burst of linear-momentum flux emitted slightly before coalescence. When using the most natural expression for the linear-momentum flux during the plunge, together with a Taylor-expanded (v/c)4 correction factor, we find that the maximum value of the terminal recoil is ∼74 km/s and occurs for η=(m1m2)/(m1+m2)2≃0.2, i.e., for a mass ratio m2/m1≃0.38.

The 3PN result is also in remarkable agreement with a numerical calculation of the ICO in the case of two corotating black holes moving on exactly circular orbits. The behaviour of the post-Newtonian series suggests that the gravitational dynamics of two bodies of comparable masses does not resemble that of a test particle on a Schwarzschild background.

We find a remarkable agreement, both in phase and in amplitude, between the new EOB waveform and the published numerical data. More precisely: (i) in the gravitational wave (GW) frequency domain Mω<0.08 where the phase of one of the nonresummed “Taylor approximant” (T4) waveform matches well with the numerical relativity one, we find that the EOB phase fares as well, while (ii) for higher GW frequencies, 0.08<Mω≲0.14, where the Taylor T4 approximant starts to significantly diverge from the numerical relativity phase, we show that the EOB phase continues to match well the numerical relativity one. We further propose various methods of tuning the two inspiral flexibility parameters, a5 and vpole, of the EOB waveform so as to “best fit” EOB predictions to numerical data. We find that the maximal dephasing between EOB and numerical relativity can then be reduced below 10-3 GW cycles over the entire span (30 GW cycles) of the simulation (while, without tuning them, the dephasing is <8×10-3 cycles).

Using a coherent-network analysis, we find that the LIGO-Virgo network can localize 50% of their ~8 sigma detected neutron star binaries to better than 50 sq.deg. with 95% confidence region. The addition of LCGT and LIGO-Australia improves this to 12 sq.deg.. Using a more conservative coincident detection threshold, we find that 50% of detected neutron star binaries are localized to 13 sq.deg. using the LIGO-Virgo network, and to 3 sq.deg. using the LIGO-Virgo-LCGT-LIGO-Australia network.

Coalescing binary systems are one of the most promising sources of gravitational waves. This is due to the fact that such sources are easier to model and thus one can design detection strategies particularly tuned to such signals.

It is important to estimate the error of such waveforms. Previous studies have identified the PN contribution as the dominant source of error, which can be reduced by incorporating longer NR simulations. There are two outstanding issues that make it difficult to determine the minimum simulation length necessary to produce suitably accurate hybrids: (1) the relevant criteria for a signal search is the mismatch between the true waveform and a set of model waveforms, optimized over all waveforms in the model. For discrete hybrids this optimization is not possible. (2) these calculations require that NR waveforms already exist, while ideally we would like to know the necessary length before performing the simulation. Here we overcome these difficulties by developing a general procedure that allows us to estimate hybrid mismatch errors without numerical data, and to optimize them over all physical parameters. Using this procedure we find that, contrary to some earlier studies, ~10 NR orbits before merger allow for the construction of waveform families that are accurate enough for detection in a broad range of parameters, only excluding highly spinning, unequal-mass systems. Nonspinning binaries, even with high mass-ratio (>20) are well modeled for astrophysically reasonable component masses. In addition, the parameter bias is only of the order of 1% for total mass and symmetric mass-ratio and less than 0.1 for the dimensionless spin magnitude.

We provide an explicit model for the merger-ringdown radiation, and demonstrate that this model agrees to fitting factors better than 95% with the original numerical waveforms for system masses above ~ 150 MSun.

Previous work by D’Eath and others has shown that to high accuracy the body moves along a geodesic of the surrounding spacetime geometry, and Fermi-Walker transports its angular-momentum vector. This paper derives the largest corrections to the geodesic law of motion and Fermi-Walker law of transport. These corrections are due to coupling of the body’s angular momentum and quadrupole moment to the Riemann curvature of the surrounding spacetime. The resulting laws of motion and precession are identical to those that have been derived previously, by many researchers, for test bodies with negligible self-gravity. However, the derivation given here is valid for any isolated body, regardless of the strength of its self-gravity. These laws of motion and precession can be converted into equations of motion and precession by combining them with an approximate solution to the Einstein field equations for the surrounding spacetime. As an example, the conversion is carried out for two gravitationally bound systems of bodies with sizes much less than their separations. The resulting equations of motion and precession are derived accurately through post1.5-Newtonian order. For the special case of two Kerr black holes orbiting each other, these equations of motion and precession (which include couplings of the holes’ spins and quadrupole moments to spacetime curvature) reduce to equations previously derived by D’Eath. The precession due to coupling of a black hole’s quadrupole moment to surrounding curvature may be large enough, if the hole lives at the center of a very dense star cluster, for observational detection by its effects on extragalactic radio jets. Unless the hole rotates very slowly, this quadrupole-induced precession is far larger than the spin-down of the hole by tidal distortion (‘‘horizon viscosity’’). When the hole is in orbit around a massive companion, the quadrupole-induced precession is far smaller than geodetic precession.'), (3358, '2011-07-25 11:03:35'), (3359, 'http://prd.aps.org.proxy.library.cornell.edu/pdf/PRD/v31/i8/p1815_1'), (3360, '2011-07-25 11:03:37'), (3361, 'Next-to-next-to-leading order post-Newtonian spin(1)-spin(2) Hamiltonian for self-gravitating binaries'), (3362, '2011-07-21 2011-07-21'), (3363, 'http://arxiv.org/abs/1107.4294'), (3364, '1107.4294'), (3365, 'We present the next-to-next-to-leading order post-Newtonian (PN) spin(1)-spin(2) Hamiltonian for two self-gravitating spinning compact objects.

We find that the NS is tidally disrupted irrespective of the mass ratio when the BH has a moderately large prograde spin, whereas only binaries with low mass ratios, MBH/MNS <~ 3 or small compactnesses of the NSs, bring the tidal disruption when the BH spin is zero or retrograde. The mass of the remnant disk is accordingly large as >~ 0.1 Msun, which is required by central engines of short gamma-ray bursts, if the BH spin is prograde. Information of the tidal disruption is reflected in a clear relation between the compactness of the NS and an appropriately defined \"cutoff frequency\" in the gravitational-wave spectrum, above which the spectrum damps exponentially. We find that the tidal disruption of the NS and excitation of the quasinormal mode of the remnant BH occur in a compatible manner in high mass-ratio binaries with the prograde BH spin. The correlation between the compactness and the cutoff frequency still holds for such cases. It is also suggested by extrapolation that the merger of an extremely spinning BH and an irrotational NS binary does not lead to formation of an overspinning BH.'), (3544, '2011-08-08 19:48:50'), (3545, 'Gravitational waves from spinning black hole-neutron star binaries'), (3546, '1108.1189 PDF'), (3547, 'http://www.arxiv.org/pdf/1108.1189.pdf'), (3548, '2011-08-08 19:49:15'), (3549, 'lcot_errors.pdf'), (3550, 'Errors and Omissions in Marc Alexa’s “Linear Combination of Transformations”'), (3551, 'http://www.cbloom.com/3d/techdocs/lcot_errors.pdf'), (3552, '2011-09-13 2011-09-13'), (3553, '2011-08-09'), (3554, 'Scientific Potential of Einstein Telescope'), (3555, 'http://arxiv.org/abs/1108.1423'), (3556, '1108.1423'), (3557, \"Einstein gravitational-wave Telescope (ET) is a design study funded by the European Commission to explore the technological challenges of and scientific benefits from building a third generation gravitational wave detector.

Expressions for the waveform polarizations and spin-weighted spherical-harmonic modes are derived for elliptic, hyperbolic, parabolic, and radial orbits. In the hyperbolic, parabolic, and radial cases the nonlinear memory provides a 2.5 post-Newtonian (PN) correction to the leading-order waveforms. This is in contrast to the elliptical and quasicircular cases, where the nonlinear memory corrects the waveform at leading (0PN) order. This difference in PN order arises from the fact that the memory builds up over a short \"scattering\" timescale in the hyperbolic case, as opposed to a much longer radiation-reaction timescale in the elliptical case. The nonlinear memory corrections presented here complete our knowledge of the leading-order (Peters-Mathews) waveforms for elliptical orbits. These calculations are also relevant for binaries with quasicircular orbits in the present epoch which had, in the past, large eccentricities.

This problem can be overcome by applying an eccentricity-removal procedure which consists of evolving the binary black hole for a couple of orbits, estimating the resulting eccentricity, and then restarting the simulation with corrected initial conditions. The presence of spins can complicate this procedure. As predicted by post-Newtonian theory, spin-spin interactions and precession prevent the binary from moving along an adiabatic sequence of spherical orbits, inducing oscillations in the radial separation and in the orbital frequency. For single-spin binary black holes these oscillations are a direct consequence of monopole-quadrupole interactions. However, spin-induced oscillations occur at approximately twice the orbital frequency, and therefore can be distinguished and disentangled from the initial spurious eccentricity which occurs at approximately the orbital frequency. Taking this into account, we develop a new eccentricity-removal procedure based on the derivative of the orbital frequency and find that it is rather successful in reducing the eccentricity measured in the orbital frequency to values less than 10-4 when moderate spins are present. We test this new procedure using numerical-relativity simulations of binary black holes with mass ratios 1.5 and 3, spin magnitude 0.5, and various spin orientations.

For these cases, for almost all choices of binary parameters, the motion is a simple precession of the orbital angular momentum around the nearly fixed direction of the total angular momentum, with a few tens of precession periods as the waves sweep through the LIGO/VIRGO observational band. However, when the spin and orbital angular momenta are approximately anti-aligned, there is a transitional-precession epoch during which their near cancellation causes the binary to \"lose its gyroscopic bearings\" and tumble in space, with a corresponding peculiar sweep of the waveform modulation.

With recent advances in post-Newtonian (PN) theory and numerical relativity (NR) it has become possible to construct inspiral-merger-ringdown waveforms by combining both descriptions into one complete hybrid signal. While addressing the reliability of such waveforms in different points of the physical parameter space, previous studies have identified the PN contribution as the dominant source of error, which can be reduced by incorporating longer NR simulations. In this paper we overcome the two outstanding issues that make it difficult to determine the minimum simulation length necessary to produce suitably accurate hybrids for GW astronomy applications: (1) the relevant criteria for a GW search is the mismatch between the true waveform and a set of model waveforms, optimized over all waveforms in the model, but for discrete hybrids this optimization was not yet possible. (2) these calculations typically require that numerical waveforms already exist, while we develop an algorithm to estimate hybrid mismatch errors without numerical data, which enables us to estimate the necessary NR waveform length before performing the simulation. Our procedure relies on combining supposedly equivalent PN models at highest available order with common data in the NR regime, and their difference serves as a measure of the uncertainty assumed in each waveform. Contrary to some earlier studies, we estimate that ∼10 NR orbits before merger should allow for the construction of waveform families that are accurate enough for detection in a broad range of parameters, only excluding highly spinning, unequal-mass systems. Nonspinning systems, even with high mass-ratio (q≳20) are well modeled for astrophysically reasonable component masses. In addition, the parameter bias is only of the order of 1% for total mass and symmetric mass-ratio and less than 0.1 for the dimensionless spin magnitude. We take the view that similar NR waveform lengths will remain the state of the art in the advanced detector era, and begin to assess the limits of the science that can be done with them.'), (3891, '245-254'), (3892, '2011-11-09 18:26:31'), (3893, 'OPERA and the GPS'), (3894, 'Animating rotation with quaternion curves'), (3895, '2011-10-03 20:19:30'), (3896, 'ACM SIGGRAPH Computer Graphics'), (3897, '00978930'), (3898, '1985-07-01 1985-07-01'), (3899, '10.1145/325165.325242'), (3900, 'http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=325165.325242'), (3901, 'p245-shoemake.pdf'), (3902, 'http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.132.20'), (3903, 'Practical parameterization of rotations using the exponential map'), (3904, 'JOURNAL OF GRAPHICS TOOLS'), (3905, '1998-00-00 1998'), (3906, '29--48'), (3907, '0264-9381, 1361-6382'), (3908, '2010-04-21 2010-04-21'), (3909, '084034'), (3910, '10.1088/0264-9381/27/8/084034'), (3911, 'http://iopscience.iop.org/0264-9381/27/8/084034'), (3912, 'Advances in simulations of generic black-hole binaries'), (3913, 'Intitute of Physics'), (3914, '2011-10-06 15:27:00'), (3915, '0264-9381_26_15_153001.pdf'), (3916, 'http://iopscience.iop.org.proxy.library.cornell.edu/0264-9381/26/15/153001/pdf/0264-9381_26_15_153001.pdf'), (3917, '0264-9381_27_8_084034.pdf'), (3918, 'Comparison of Post-Newtonian and Numerical Evolutions of Black-Hole Binaries'), (3919, '2009-01-24 2009-01-24'), (3920, 'http://arxiv.org/abs/0901.3861'), (3921, 'arXiv:0901.3861'), (3922, 'In this paper, we compare the waveforms from the post-Newtonian (PN) approach with the numerical simulations of generic black-hole binaries which have mass ratio $q\\\\sim0.8$, arbitrarily oriented spins with magnitudes $S_1/m_1^2\\\\sim0.6$ and $S_2/m_2^2\\\\sim0.4$, and orbit 9 times from an initial orbital separation of $r\\\\approx11M$ prior to merger.

The theory is constructed in a flat background spacetime and employs gauge fields to ensure that all relations between physical quantities are independent of the position and orientation of the matter fields. In this manner all properties of the background spacetime are removed from physics and what remains are a set of ‘intrinsic’ relations between physical fields. For a wide range of phenomena, including all present experimental tests, the theory reproduces the predictions of general relativity. Differences do emerge, however, through the first–order nature of the equations and the global properties of the gauge fields and through the relationship with quantum theory. The properties of the gravitational gauge fields are derived from both classical and quantum viewpoints. Field equations are then derived from an action principle and consistency with the minimal coupling procedure selects an action which is unique up to the possible inclusion of a cosmological constant. This in turn singles out a unique form of spin–torsion interaction. A new method for solving the field equations is outlined and applied to the case of a time–dependent, spherically symmetric perfect fluid. A gauge is found which reduces the physics to a set of essentially Newtonian equations. These equations are then applied to the study of cosmology and to the formation and properties of black holes. Insistence on finding global solutions, together with the first–order nature of the equations, leads to a new understanding of the role played by time reversal. This alters the physical picture of the properties of a horizon around a black hole. The existence of global solutions enables one to discuss the properties of field lines inside the horizon due to a point charge held outside it. The Dirac equation is studied in a black hole background and provides a quick (though ultimately unsound) derivation of the Hawking temperature. Some applications to cosmology are also discussed and a study of the Dirac equation in a cosmological background reveals that the only models consistent with homogeneity are spatially flat. It is emphasized throughout that the description of gravity in terms of gauge fields, rather than spacetime geometry, leads to many simple and powerful physical insights. The language of ‘geometric algebra’ best expresses the physical and mathematical content of the theory and is employed throughout.

Next we derive an exact solution for a specific case of initial perturbations, for which application of the Kolb et al. expressions leads to an acceleration, while the exact solution reveals that no acceleration is present. We show that the discrepancy can be traced to higher-order terms that were dropped in the Kolb et al. analysis. We proceed with the analysis of initial value formulation of general relativity to argue that causality severely limits what observable effects can be derived from superhorizon perturbations. By constructing a Riemann normal coordinate system on initial slice we show that no infrared divergence terms arise in this coordinate system. Thus any divergences found previously can be eliminated by a local rescaling of coordinates and are unobservable. We perform an explicit analysis of the variance of the deceleration parameter for the case of single-field inflation using usual coordinates and show that the infrared-divergent terms found by Barausse et al. and Kolb et al. cancel against several additional terms not considered in their analysis.

The result indicates that second order corrections to q0 are present, but shows that if q0 is negative then its magnitude is constrained to be less than or of the order of the square of the peculiar velocity on Hubble scales today.

Quantities of particular interest for many calculations are the Weyl scalar ψ4, which is simply related to the flux of gravitational waves far from the source, and the flux of energy carried to distant observers, E˙. Conservation laws guarantee that, in asympotically flat spacetimes, ψ4∝1/r and E˙∝1/r2 as r→∞. Most calculations extract these quantities at some finite extraction radius. An understanding of finite radius corrections to ψ4 and E˙ allows us to more accurately infer their asymptotic values from a computation. In this paper, we show that, if the final state of the system is a black hole, then the leading correction to ψ4 is O(1/r3), and that to the energy flux is O(1/r4)—not O(1/r2) and O(1/r3), as one might naively guess. Our argument only relies on the behavior of the curvature scalars for black hole spacetimes. Using black hole perturbation theory, we calculate the corrections to the leading falloff, showing that it is quite easy to correct for finite extraction radius effects.'), (4296, '2011-10-24 03:01:22'), (4297, 'http://prd.aps.org.proxy.library.cornell.edu/pdf/PRD/v82/i10/e104029'), (4298, '2011-10-24 03:01:24'), (4299, 'Reading off gravitational radiation waveforms in numerical relativity calculations: Matching to linearized gravity'), (4300, 37), (4301, '318-332'), (4302, '1988-01-15 January 15, 1988'), (4303, 'http://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevD.37.318'), (4304, '10.1103/PhysRevD.37.318'), (4305, 'Two methods are described, both based on the use of multipole moments in linearized gravity, to read off gravitational radiation waveforms during numerical relativity simulations. In the first, matching is made at a finite radius in the weak-field exterior of a strong-field source to an analytic template developed via an infinitesimal gauge transformation from a general solution to the vacuum weak-field equations. The matching procedure allows the asymptotic waveforms to be separated from the confusing influences of the source’s (e.g., black hole, neutron star, collapsing stellar core) stationary moments, the wave’s near-zone field, and gauge dependencies in the metric. This is achieved by computing the multipole-moment amplitudes of the gravitational field with a set of surface integrals of the metric over one (or more) coordinate two-sphere(s). The two-surface(s) need not be placed far out in the local wave zone, nor does the method require the existence of a deep near zone (i.e., the source need not be slow motion). The procedure is demonstrated through its application to two standard axisymmetric numerical relativity gauges (quasi-isotropic and radial). The second matching approach uses a surface integral over components of the Riemann tensor to eliminate gauge effects. The near-zone field is separated off as in the previous method.

First, we consider the horizon mass and spin evolution of the new aligned-spin simulation. During the inspiral, the horizon area and spin evolve in remarkably close agreement with Alvi's analytic predictions, and the remnant hole's final spin agrees reasonably well with several analytic predictions. We also find that the total energy emitted by a real astrophysical system with these parameters---almost all of which is radiated during the time included in this simulation---would be 10.952% of the initial mass at infinite separation. Second, we consider the gravitational waveforms for both simulations. After estimating their uncertainties, we compare the waveforms to several post-Newtonian approximants, finding significant disagreement well before merger, although the phase of the TaylorT4 approximant happens to agree remarkably well with the numerical prediction in the aligned-spin case.

We analytically derive and solve the coupled field equations in the post-Newtonian approximation, assuming a comparable-mass, spinning black hole binary source in a quasi-circular, weak-field/slow-motion orbit. We find that a naive subtraction of divergent piece associated with the point-particle approximation is ill-suited to represent compact objects in these theories. Instead, we model them by appropriate effective sources built so that known strong-field solutions are reproduced in the far-field limit. In doing so, we prove that black holes in Einstein-Dilaton-Gauss-Bonnet and Chern-Simons theory can have hair, while neutron stars have no scalar monopole charge, in diametrical opposition to results in scalar-tensor theories. We then employ techniques similar to the direct integration of the relaxed Einstein equations to obtain analytic expressions for the scalar field, metric perturbation, and the associated gravitational wave luminosity measured at infinity. We find that scalar field emission mainly dominates the energy flux budget, sourcing electric-type (even-parity) dipole scalar radiation and magnetic-type (odd-parity) quadrupole scalar radiation, correcting the General Relativistic prediction at relative -1PN and 2PN orders.

The resulting resonant energy transfer between the orbit and the neutron star speeds up or slows down the inspiral, depending on whether the resonant mode has positive or negative energy, and induces a phase change in the emitted gravitational waves from the binary. While only g-modes can be excited for a non-rotating neutron star, f-modes and r-modes can also be excited when the neutron star is spinning. A tidal resonance, designated by the index (\\xa0jk, m) ({\\xa0jk} specifies the angular order of the mode, as in the spherical harmonic Yjk), occurs when the mode frequency equals m times the orbital frequency. For the f-mode resonance to occur before coalescence, the neutron star must have rapid rotation, with spin frequency νs≳710\\xa0Hz for the (22,2)-resonance and νs≳570\\xa0Hz for the (33,3)-resonance (assuming canonical neutron star mass, M=1.4\\xa0M⊙, and radius, R=10\\xa0km; however, for R=15\\xa0km, these critical spin frequencies become 330 and 260\\xa0Hz, respectively). Although current observations suggest that such high rotation rates may be unlikely for coalescing binary neutron stars, these rates are physically allowed. Because of their strong tidal coupling, the f-mode resonances induce a large change in the number of orbital cycles of coalescence, ΔNorb, with the maximum ΔNorb∼10–1000 for the (22,2)-resonance and ΔNorb∼1 for the (33,3)-resonance. Such f-mode resonant effects, if present, must be included in constructing the templates of waveforms used in searching for gravitational wave signals. Higher order f-mode resonances can occur at slower rotation rates, but the induced orbital change is much smaller (ΔNorb≲0.1). For the dominant g-mode (22,2)-resonance, even modest rotation (νs≲100\\xa0Hz) can enhance the resonant effect on the orbit by shifting the resonance to a smaller orbital frequency. However, because of the weak coupling between the g-mode and the tidal potential, ΔNorb lies in the range 10−3–10−2 (depending strongly on the neutron star equation of state) and is probably negligible for the purpose of detecting gravitational waves. Resonant excitations of r-modes require misaligned spin–orbit inclinations, and the dominant resonances correspond to octopolar excitations of the jk=2 mode, with  (jk, m)=(22,3) and (22,1). Since the tidal coupling of the r-mode depends strongly on rotation rate, ΔNorb≲10−2(R/10\\xa0km)10(M/1.4\\xa0M⊙)−20/3 is negligible for canonical neutron star parameters, but can be appreciable if the neutron star radius is larger.'), (4615, '2011-11-13 20:33:19'), (4616, 'http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com.proxy.library.cornell.edu/store/10.1046/j.1365-8711.1999.02703.x/asset/j.1365-8711.1999.02703.x.pdf?v=1&t=guyi4qk8&s=6f5e152f902d8a3150bb29a1b78d65af7f5ef11d'), (4617, '2011-11-13 20:33:21'), (4618, 'Cosmological distance indicators by coalescing binaries'), (4619, '2011-11-11 2011-11-11'), (4620, 'http://arxiv.org/abs/1111.2816'), (4621, 'arXiv:1111.2816'), (4622, 'Gravitational waves detected from well-localized inspiraling binaries would allow to determine, directly and independently, both binary luminosity and redshift.

The key aspect of the framework is testing the consistency of the post-Newtonian gravitational-wave phase coefficients in the inspiral regime with the predictions made by GR, without relying on any specific alternative theory of gravity. The framework is suitable for low signal-to-noise events through construction of multiple subtests, most of which involving only a limited number of phase coefficients. The framework also naturally allows for the combination of multiple sources to increase the information extracted for GR testing. In our previous work, we conjectured that this framework can detect generic deviations from GR that can in principle not be accomodated by our model waveforms, on condition that the change in phase near frequencies where the detectors are the most sensitive is comparable to that induced by simple shifts in the lower-order phase coefficients of more than a few percent. To further support this claim, we perform additional numerical experiments in Gaussian and stationary noise according to the expected Advanced LIGO/Virgo noise curves, and injecting signals whose phasing differs structurally from the predictions of GR, but with the magnitude of the deviation still being small.

For interferometric space-based detectors similar to LISA, which are sensitive to long-lived signals and have constantly changing position and orientation, exact SNRs need to be computed on a source-by-source basis. For convenience, most authors prefer to work with sky-averaged sensitivities, accepting inaccurate SNRs for individual sources and giving up control over the statistical distribution of SNRs for source populations. In this paper, we describe a straightforward end-to-end recipe to compute the non-sky-averaged sensitivity of interferometric space-based detectors of any geometry, and we use it to generate a sampling distribution of sensitivities for a given source population. In effect, we derive error bars for the sky-averaged sensitivity curve.

We confirm that the (standard) inverse-rms average sensitivity for the isotropic population remains the same whether or not the LISA orbits are included in the computation.

We revisit our previous statistical analysis of post-Newtonian evolutions of black-hole binaries in the light of these new findings. We demonstrate that despite these new configurations with enhanced recoil velocities, spin alignment during the post-Newtonian stage of the inspiral will still significantly suppress (or enhance) kick magnitudes when the initial spin of the more massive black hole is more (or less) closely aligned with the orbital angular momentum than that of the smaller hole. We present a preliminary study of how this post-Newtonian spin alignment affects the ejection probabilities of supermassive black holes from their host galaxies with astrophysically motivated mass ratio and initial spin distributions. We find that spin alignment suppresses (enhances) ejection probabilities by ~ 40% (20%) for an observationally motivated mass-dependent galactic escape velocity, and by an even greater amount for a constant escape velocity of 1,000 km/s.

The oscillations of this object imprint a pronounced peak in the gravitational-wave (GW) spectra, which is used to characterize the emission for a given model. The peak frequency of this postmerger GW signal correlates very well with the radii of nonrotating NSs, and thus allows to constrain the high-density EoS by a GW detection. In the case of 1.35-1.35 $M_{\\\\odot}$ mergers the peak frequency scales particularly well with the radius of a NS with 1.6 $M_{\\\\odot}$, where the maximum deviation from this correlation is only 60 meters for fully microphysical EoSs which are compatible with NS observations. Combined with the uncertainty in the determination of the peak frequency it appears likely that a GW detection can measure the radius of a 1.6 $M_{\\\\odot}$ NS with an accuracy of about 100 to 200 meters. We also uncover relations of the peak frequency with the radii of nonrotating NSs with 1.35 $M_{\\\\odot}$ or 1.8 $M_{\\\\odot}$, with the radius or the central energy density of the maximum-mass Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff configuration, and with the pressure or sound speed at a fiducial rest-mass density of about twice nuclear saturation density.

Double neutron star (DNS) binaries are expected to be one of the first sources detected after \"first-light\" of Advanced LIGO and are expected to be detected at a rate of a few tens per year in the advanced era. However the proposed Einstein Telescope (ET) could catalogue tens of thousands per year. Combining the measured source redshift distributions with GW-network distance determinations will permit not only the precision measurement of background cosmological parameters, but will provide an insight into the astrophysical properties of these DNS systems. Of particular interest will be to probe the distribution of delay times between DNS-binary creation and subsequent merger, as well as the evolution of the star-formation rate density within ET\\'s detection horizon. Keeping H_0, Omega_{m,0} and Omega_{\\\\Lambda,0} fixed and investigating the precision with which the dark energy equation-of-state parameters could be recovered, we found that with 10^5 detected DNS binaries we could constrain these parameters to an accuracy similar to forecasted constraints from future CMB+BAO+SNIa measurements. Furthermore, modeling the merger delay-time distribution as a power-law, and the star-formation rate (SFR) density as a parametrised version of the Porciani and Madau SF2 model, we find that the associated astrophysical parameters are constrained to within ~ 10%.

In this paper we describe a fast matched-filtering search scheme for precessing binaries, and we adopt the physical template family proposed by Buonanno, Chen, and Vallisneri [Phys. Rev. D 67, 104025 (2003)] for ground-based interferometers. This family provides essentially exact waveforms, written directly in terms of the physical parameters, for binaries with a single significant spin, and for which the observed GW signal is emitted during the phase of adiabatic inspiral (for LIGO-I and VIRGO, this corresponds to a total mass M≲15M⊙). We show how the detection statistic can be maximized automatically over all the parameters (including the position and orientation of the binary with respect to the detector), except four (the two masses, the magnitude of the single spin, and the opening angle between the spin and the orbital angular momentum), so the template bank used in the search is only four-dimensional; this technique is relevant also to the searches for GW from extreme-mass-ratio inspirals and supermassive black hole inspirals to be performed using the space-borne detector LISA.

Remarkably, no calibration of any tidal EOB free parameters is required, beside those already fitted to binary black holes data. The inclusion of 2PN tidal corrections minimizes the differences with the numerical data, but it is not possible to significantly distinguish them from the leading-order tidal contribution. The presence of a relevant amplification of tidal effects is likely to be excluded, although it can appear as a consequence of numerical inaccuracies.

This effect takes place when the spins of the binary members are misaligned with respect to the orbital angular momentum. As a first step we assess the importance of precession specifically for the first generation of Laser Interferometric Gravitational Wave Observatory (LIGO) detectors. We investigate the extent of the signal-to-noise ratio reduction and, hence, detection rate that occurs when precession effects are not accounted for in the template waveforms. We restrict our analysis to binary systems that undergo the so-called simple precession and have a total mass ≲10M⊙. We find that for binary systems with rather high mass ratios (e.g., a 1.4M⊙ neutron star and a 10M⊙ black hole) the detection rate can decrease by almost an order of magnitude. Current astrophysical estimates of the rate of binary inspiral events suggest that LIGO could detect at most a few events per year, and therefore the reduction of the detection rate even by a factor of a few is critical. In the second part of our analysis, we examine whether the effect of precession could be included in the templates by capturing the main features of the phase modulation through a small number of extra parameters.

We examine the sensitivity of the anticipated loss of signal-to-noise ratio on two factors: the accuracy of the precessing wave forms adopted as the true signals and the expected distributions of spin-orbit tilt angles, given the current understanding of their physical origin. We find that the results obtained using signals generated by approximate techniques are in good agreement with the ones obtained by integrating the 2PN equations. This shows that a complete account of all high-order post-Newtonian effects is usually not necessary for the determination of detection efficiencies.

The metric is expanded in negative powers of a suitably defined radial co-ordinate r, and the vacuum field equations are investigated in detail. It is shown that the flow of information to infinity is controlled by a single function of two variables called the news function. Together with initial conditions specified on a light cone, this function fully defines the behaviour of the system. No constraints of any kind are encountered. In part C, the transformations leaving the metric in the chosen form are determined. An investigation of the corresponding transformations in Minkowski space suggests that no generality is lost by assuming that the transformations, like the metric, may be expanded in negative powers of r. In part D, the mass of the system is defined in a way which in static metrics agrees with the usual definition. The principal result of the paper is then deduced, namely, that the mass of a system is constant if and only if there is no news; if there is news, the mass decreases monotonically so long as it continues. The linear approximation is next discussed, chiefly for its heuristic value, and employed in the analysis of a receiver for gravitational waves.

We show that for these systems the point mass approximation is completely justified when the individual stars are axisymmetric irrespective of their size.

We describe a new detection strategy based on recent advances in optical atomic clocks and atom interferometry which can operate at long-baselines and which is immune to laser frequency noise. Laser frequency noise is suppressed because the signal arises strictly from the light propagation time between two ensembles of atoms.

Notions relevant to the null regime are borrowed directly from Penrose’s definition of weak asymptotic simplicity. In the spatial regime, however, a new approach is adopted. The key feature of this approach is that it uses only those notions which refer to space–time as a whole, thereby avoiding the use of a initial value formulation, and, consequently, of a splitting of space–time into space and time. It is shown that the resulting description of asymptotic flatness not only encompasses the essential physical ideas behind the more familiar approaches based on the initial value formulation, but also succeeds in avoiding the global problems that usually arise. A certain 4‐manifold—called Spi (spatial infinity) —is constructed using well‐behaved, asymptotically geodesic, spacelike curves in the physical space–time. The structure of Spi is discussed in detail; in many ways, Spi turns out to be the spatial analog of I. The group of asymptotic symmetries at spatial infinity is examined. In its structure, this group turns out to be very similar to the BMS group. It is further shown that for the class of asymptotically flat space–times satisfying an additional condition on the (asymptotic behavior of the ’’magnetic’’ part of the) Weyl tensor, a Poincaré (sub‐) group can be selected from the group of asymptotic symmetries in a canonical way. (This additional condition is rather weak: In essence, it requires only that the angular momentum contribution to the asymptotic curvature be of a higher order than the energy–momentum contribution.) Thus, for this (apparently large) class of space–times, the symmetry group at spatial infinity is just the Poincaré group. Scalar, electromagnetic and gravitational fields are then considered, and their limiting behavior at spatial infinity is examined. In each case, the asymptotic field satisfies a simple, linear differential equation. Finally, conserved quantities are constructed using these asymptotic fields. Total charge and 4‐momentum are defined for arbitrary asymptotically flat space–times. These definitions agree with those in the literature, but have a further advantage of being both intrinsic and free of ambiguities which usually arise from global problems. A definition of angular momentum is then proposed for the class of space–times satisfying the additional condition on the (asymptotic behavior of the) Weyl tensor. This definition is intimately intertwined with the fact that, for this class of space–times, the group of asymptotic symmetries at spatial infinity is just the Poincaré group; in particular, the definition is free of super‐translation ambiguities. It is shown that this angular momentum has the correct transformation properties. In the next paper, the formalism developed here will be seen to provide a platform for discussing in detail the relationship between the structure of the gravitational field at null infinity and that at spatial infinity.'), (5690, '0264-9381_21_23_008-1.pdf'), (5691, '2009-02-21 2009-02-21'), (5692, '048002'), (5693, '10.1088/0264-9381/26/4/048002'), (5694, 'http://iopscience.iop.org/0264-9381/26/4/048002'), (5695, 'A note on computations of angular momentum and its flux in numerical relativity'), (5696, '2012-06-13 14:25:16'), (5697, '1978-07-01 1978-07-01'), (5698, 'Practical formula for the radiated angular momentum'), (5699, '041502'), (5700, 'http://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevD.76.041502'), (5701, '10.1103/PhysRevD.76.041502'), (5702, 'We present a simple formula for the radiated angular momentum based on a spin-weighted spherical harmonic decomposition of the Weyl scalar ψ4 representing outgoing radiation in the Kinnersley tetrad.

In black hole perturbation theory, the Teukolsky formalism uses such adapted tetrads, those which differ only perturbatively from the background Kinnersley tetrad. At late times, numerical simulations of astrophysical processes producing isolated black holes ought to admit descriptions in the Teukolsky formalism. However, adapted tetrads in this context must be identified using only the numerically computed metric, since no background Kerr geometry is known a priori. To do this, this paper introduces the notion of a quasi-Kinnersley frame. This frame, when space-time is perturbatively close to Kerr, approximates the background Kinnersley frame. However, it remains calculable much more generally, in space-times non-perturbatively different from Kerr.

A key reason is that the presence of a fixed minimum length would seem to contradict the ability of Lorentz transformations to contract lengths. In this paper, we implement a fully covariant Planck scale cutoff by cutting off the spectrum of the d'Alembertian. In this scenario, consistent with Lorentz contractions, wavelengths that are arbitrarily smaller than the Planck length continue to exist. However, the dynamics of modes of wavelengths that are significantly smaller than the Planck length possess a very small bandwidth. This has the effect of freezing the dynamics of such modes. While both, wavelengths and bandwidths, are frame dependent, Lorentz contraction and time dilation conspire to make the freezing of modes of transplanckian wavelengths covariant. In particular, we show that this ultraviolet cutoff can be implemented covariantly also in curved spacetimes. We focus on Friedmann Robertson Walker (FRW) spacetimes and their much-discussed transplanckian question: The physical wavelength of each comoving mode was smaller than the Planck scale at sufficiently early times. What was the mode's dynamics then? Here, we show that in the presence of the covariant UV cutoff, the dynamical bandwidth of a comoving mode is essentially zero up until its physical wavelength starts exceeding the Planck length. In particular, we show that under general assumptions, the number of dynamical degrees of freedom of each comoving mode all the way up to some arbitrary finite time is actually finite.

The most effective method to look for a signal with a well understood waveform, such as the binary black hole signal, is matched filtering against a library of model waveforms. Current model waveforms are comprised solely of the dominant radiation mode, the quadrupole mode, although it is known that there can be significant power in the higher-order modes. The binary black hole waveforms produced by numerical relativity are accurate through late inspiral, merger, and ringdown and include the higher-order modes. The available numerical-relativity waveforms span an increasing portion of the physical parameter space of unequal mass, spin and precession. In this paper, we investigate the degree to which gravitational-wave searches could be improved by the inclusion of higher modes in the model waveforms, for signals with a variety of initial mass ratios and generic spins. Our investigation studies how well the quadrupole-only waveform model matches the signal as a function of the inclination and orientation of the source and how the modes contribute to the distance reach into the Universe of Advanced LIGO for a fixed set of internal source parameters. The mismatch between signals and quadrupole-only waveform can be large, dropping below 0.97 for up to 65% of the source-sky for the non-precessing cases we studied, and over a larger area in one precessing case. There is a corresponding 30% increase in detection volume that could be achieved by adding higher modes to the search; however, this is mitigated by the fact that the mismatch is largest for signals which radiate the least energy and to which the search is therefore least sensitive.

Hence the effectualness of nonspinning templates is particularly poor in this case, as compared to non-precessing-spin templates.

This quantity allows one to solve the (orbit-averaged) precession equations exactly in the case of equal masses and arbitrary spins, neglecting radiation reaction.

We demonstrate the gravitational wave polarization encodes the orientation of this direction to the line of sight. We argue the effects of polarization can be estimated nonparametrically, directly from the gravitational wave signal as seen along one line of sight, as a slowly-varying feature on top of a rapidly-varying carrier. After merger, our results can be interpreted as a coherent excitation of quasinormal modes of different angular orders, a superposition which naturally \"precesses\" and modulates the line-of-sight amplitude. Recent analytic calculations have arrived at a similar geometric interpretation. We suspect the line-of-sight polarization content will be a convenient observable with which to define new high-precision tests of general relativity using gravitational waves. Additionally, as the nonlinear merger process seeds the initial coherent perturbation, we speculate the amplitude of this effect provides a new probe of the strong-field dynamics during merger. To demonstrate the ubiquity of the effects we describe, we summarize the post-merger evolution of 104 generic precessing binary mergers.

Checks of the result include the existence of a conserved energy, the approximate global Lorentz invariance of the equations of motion in harmonic coordinates, and the recovery of the motion of a spinning object on a Kerr background in the test-mass limit. We verified the existence of a contact transformation, together with a redefinition of the spin variables that makes our result equivalent to a previously published reduced Hamiltonian, obtained from the Arnowitt-Deser-Misner (ADM) formalism.\"), (6224, '2013-01-02 05:40:20'), (6225, '1210.4143 PDF'), (6226, 'http://www.arxiv.org/pdf/1210.4143.pdf'), (6227, 'Fitting Smooth Paths to Spherical Data'), (6228, '2013-01-09 19:59:54'), (6229, '2013-01-16 2013-01-16'), (6230, '0264-9381_29_12_124001.pdf'), (6231, 'Index IUPAP Red Book « Applications of statistics in Measurement & Testing'), (6232, 'http://metrology.wordpress.com/measurement-process-index/iupap-red-book/index-iupap-red-book/'), (6233, '2013-01-10 15:50:34'), (6234, 'IUPAP Red Book'), (6235, '2013-01-10 15:51:05'), (6236, 'IUPAP Red book « Applications of statistics in Measurement & Testing'), (6237, 'http://metrology.wordpress.com/measurement-process-index/iupap-red-book/'), (6238, '2013-01-10 15:51:31'), (6239, \"This thesis concerns numerical relativity, the attempt to study Einstein's theory of gravitation using numerical discretization.

We find that the gravitational radiation from binary systems with large mass asymmetry and large inclination angle can be distributed among several modes. For example, during the last stages of inspiral, for some maximally spinning configurations, the amplitude of the (2,0) and (2,1) modes can be comparable to the amplitude of the (2,2) mode. If the mass ratio is not too extreme, the l=3 and l=4 modes are generally one or two orders of magnitude smaller than the l = 2 modes.

Since spin effects in the amplitude through 2PN order affect only the first and second harmonics of the orbital phase, they do not extend the mass reach of gravitational-wave detectors.

For slowly rotating black holes, the quasinormal mode’s real frequency is a linear combination of the orbit’s precessional and orbital frequencies, but the correspondence is otherwise unchanged. In this paper, we find a relationship between the quasinormal-mode frequencies of Kerr black holes of arbitrary (astrophysical) spins and general spherical photon orbits, which is analogous to the relationship for slowly rotating holes. To derive this result, we first use the Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin approximation to compute accurate algebraic expressions for large-l quasinormal-mode frequencies. Comparing our Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin calculation to the leading-order, geometric-optics approximation to scalar-wave propagation in the Kerr spacetime, we then draw a correspondence between the real parts of the parameters of a quasinormal mode and the conserved quantities of spherical photon orbits. At next-to-leading order in this comparison, we relate the imaginary parts of the quasinormal-mode parameters to coefficients that modify the amplitude of the scalar wave. With this correspondence, we find a geometric interpretation of two features of the quasinormal-mode spectrum of Kerr black holes: First, for Kerr holes rotating near the maximal rate, a large number of modes have nearly zero damping; we connect this characteristic to the fact that a large number of spherical photon orbits approach the horizon in this limit. Second, for black holes of any spins, the frequencies of specific sets of modes are degenerate; we find that this feature arises when the spherical photon orbits corresponding to these modes form closed (as opposed to ergodically winding) curves.'), (6296, '2013-01-23 16:26:40'), (6297, 'http://prd.aps.org/pdf/PRD/v86/i10/e104006'), (6298, 'Phys.

Existing codes for evolving binary black holes rely on explicit timestepping methods, for which the timestep size is limited by the smallest spatial scale through the Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy condition. Binary inspiral typically involves spatial scales (the spatial resolution required by a small or rapidly spinning hole) which are orders of magnitude smaller than the relevant (orbital, precession, and radiation-reaction) timescales characterizing the inspiral. Therefore, in explicit evolutions of binary black holes, the timestep size is typically orders of magnitude smaller than the relevant physical timescales. Implicit timestepping methods allow for larger timesteps, and they often reduce the total computational cost (without significant loss of accuracy) for problems dominated by spatial rather than temporal error, such as for binary-black-hole inspiral in corotating coordinates. However, fully implicit methods can be difficult to implement for nonlinear evolution systems like the Einstein equations. Therefore, in this paper we explore implicit-explicit (IMEX) methods and use them for the first time to evolve black-hole spacetimes. Specifically, as a first step toward IMEX evolution of a full binary-black-hole spacetime, we develop an IMEX algorithm for the generalized harmonic formulation of the Einstein equations and use this algorithm to evolve stationary and perturbed single-black-hole spacetimes.

We demonstrate that in the sensitive band of Advanced LIGO, the angle between the binary’s orbital angular momentum and its total angular momentum is approximately constant. Under this constant precession cone approximation, we show that the gravitational-wave phasing is modulated in two ways: a secular increase of the gravitational-wave phase due to precession and an oscillation around this secular increase. We show that this secular evolution occurs in precisely three ways, corresponding to physically different apparent evolutions of the binary’s precession about the line of sight. We estimate the best possible fitting factor between any nonprecessing template model and a single precessing signal, in the limit of a constant precession cone. Our closed-form estimate of the fitting factor depends only the geometry of the in-band precession cone; it does not depend explicitly on binary parameters, detector response, or details of either signal model.

We find that a fourth detector site can break degeneracies in several parameters; in particular, the localization of the source on the sky is improved by a factor of ∼3–4 for an Australian site, or ∼2.5–3.5 for an Indian site, with more modest improvements in distance and binary inclination estimates.

We further identify three regions in the IMRAC mass-space in which: (i) inspiral-only searches could be performed with losses in detection rates L in the range 10% < L < 27%, (ii) searches based on inspiral-only templates lead to a loss in detection rates in the range 27% < L < 50%$, and (iii) templates that include merger and ringdown are essential to prevent losses in detection rates greater than 50%.

The physical observables in Schrödinger–Pauli theory and Dirac theory are found, and the relationship between Dirac, Lorentz, Weyl, and Majorana spinors is made explicit.

In principle, all of these quantities depend on the neutron star's internal structure, and thus, on unknown nuclear physics at supra-nuclear energy densities. We here find relations between the moment of inertia, the Love numbers and the quadrupole moment (I-Love-Q relations) that do not depend sensitively on the neutron star's internal structure. Such universality may arise for two reasons: (i) these relations depend most sensitively on the internal structure far from the core, where all realistic equations of state mostly approach each other; (ii) as the NS compactness increases, the I-Love-Q trio approaches that of a BH, which does not have an internal-structure dependence. Three important consequences derive from these I-Love-Q relations. On an observational astrophysics front, the measurement of a single member of the I-Love-Q trio would automatically provide information about the other two, even when the latter may not be observationally accessible. On a gravitational wave front, the I-Love-Q relations break the degeneracy between the quadrupole moment and the neutron-star spins in binary inspiral waveforms, allowing second-generation ground-based detectors to determine the (dimensionless) averaged spin to 0.01. On a fundamental physics front, the I-Love-Q relations allow for tests of General Relativity in the neutron-star strong-field that are both theory- and internal structure-independent.

The four complex variablesZ α are the components of a twistor.

The twistor formalism is adapted so as to be applicable in curved space-times. The effect of conformai curvature in theM-picture is studied by consideration of plane (-fronted) gravitational ‘sandwich’ waves. TheC-picture still exists, but its complex structure ‘shifts’ as it is ‘viewed’ from different regions of the space-time. A weaker symplectic structure remains.

While the high-frequency peak has already been associated with the oscillations of the hypermassive neutron star produced by the merger and depends on the equation of state, a new correlation emerges between the low-frequency peak, related to the merger process, and the compactness of the progenitor stars. More importantly, such a correlation is essentially universal, thus providing a powerful tool to set tight constraints on the equation of state. If the mass of the binary is known from the inspiral signal, the combined use of the two frequency peaks sets four simultaneous constraints to be satisfied.

The method relies on a small number of detections of the peak frequency in the postmerger phase for binaries of different (relatively low) masses, in the most likely range of expected detections. From such observations, one can construct the derivative of the peak frequency versus the binary mass, in this mass range. Through a detailed study of binary neutron star mergers for a large sample of equations of state, we show that one can extrapolate the above information to the highest possible mass (the threshold mass for black hole formation in a binary neutron star merger). In turn, this allows for an empirical determination of the maximum mass of cold, nonrotating neutron stars to within 0.1 M_sun, while the corresponding radius is determined to within a few percent. Combining this with the determination of the radius of cold, nonrotating neutron stars of 1.6 M_sun (to within a few percent, as was demonstrated in Bauswein et al., PRD, 86, 063001, 2012), allows for a clear distinction of a particular candidate equation of state among a large set of other candidates. Our method is particularly appealing because it reveals simultaneously the moderate and very high-density parts of the equation of state, enabling the distinction of mass-radius relations even if they are similar at typical neutron star masses.

Orthogonal transformations are representable as multiple reflections, and by means of the geometric product this takes an efficient and structure preserving form as a ‘sandwiching product’. The antisymmetric part of the geometric product produces a spanning operation that permits the construction of lines, planes, spheres and tangents from vectors, and since the sandwiching operation distributes over this construction, ‘objects’ are fully integrated with ‘motions’. Duality and the logarithms complete the computational techniques. The resulting geometric algebra incorporates general conformal transformations and can be implemented to run almost as efficiently as classical homogeneous coordinates. It thus becomes a high-level programming language which naturally integrates quantitative computation with the automatic administration of geometric data structures.

In particular, all Clifford algebras have been classified as matrix algebras over one of the three division algebras. But Clifford Algebras are far more interesting than this classification suggests; they provide the algebraic basis for a unified language for physics and mathematics which offers many advantages over current techniques. This language is called geometric algebra - the name originally chosen by Clifford for his algebra - and this thesis is an investigation into the properties and applications of Clifford's geometric algebra. The work falls into three broad categories:\\n\\n    The formal development of geometric algebra has been patchy and a number of important subjects have not yet been treated within its framework. A principle feature of this thesis is the development of a number of new algebraic techniques which serve to broaden the field of applicability of geometric algebra. Of particular interest are an extension of the geometric algebra of spacetime (the spacetime algebra) to incorporate multiparticle quantum states, and the development of a multivector calculus for handling differentiation with respect to a linear function.\\n    A central contention of this thesis is that geometric algebra provides the natural language in which to formulate a wide range of subjects from modern mathematical physics. To support this contention, reformulations of Grassmann calculus, Lie algebra theory, spinor algebra and Lagrangian field theory are developed. In each case it is argued that the geometric algebra formulation is computationally more efficient than standard approaches, and that it provides many novel insights.\\n    The ultimate goal of a reformulation is to point the way to new mathematics and physics, and three promising directions are developed. The first is a new approach to relativistic multiparticle quantum mechanics. The second deals with classical models for quantum spin-1/2. The third details an approach to gravity based on gauge fields acting in a flat spacetime.

The differential structure on these manifolds is fixed by specifying a smooth reference metric tensor. Matching conditions that ensure the appropriate levels of continuity and differentiability across region boundaries are developed for arbitrary tensor fields.

Achieving this sensitivity and extracting the physics imprinted in observed signals requires accurate modeling of the binary to construct template waveforms. In a NSBH binary, the black hole may have significant angular momentum (spin), which affects the phase evolution of the emitted gravitational waves. We investigate the ability of post-Newtonian (PN) templates to model the gravitational waves emitted during the inspiral phase of NSBH binaries. We restrict the black hole's spin to be aligned with the orbital angular momentum and compare several approximants. We examine restricted amplitude waveforms that are accurate to 3.5PN order in the orbital dynamics and complete to 2.5PN order in the spin dynamics. We also consider PN waveforms with the recently derived 3.5PN spin-orbit and 3PN spin-orbit tail corrections. We compare these approximants to the effective-one-body model. For all these models, large disagreements start at low to moderate black hole spins, particularly for binaries where the spin is anti-aligned with the orbital angular momentum.

However, such an approach cannot be employed to define “conserved quantities” in a situation where symplectic current can be radiated away (such as occurs at null infinity in general relativity) because there does not, in general, exist a Hamiltonian which generates the given asymptotic symmetry.

The RQF approach allows us to construct, in a generic spacetime, frames of reference whose boundaries are rigid (their shape and size do not change with time), and that have precisely the same six arbitrary time-dependent degrees of freedom as the accelerating and tumbling rigid frames we are familiar with in Newtonian mechanics. These RQFs, in turn, give rise to a completely general conservation law for the six components of momentum (three linear and three angular) of a finite system of matter and gravitational fields. We compare in detail this quasilocal RQF approach to constructing conservation laws with the usual local one based on spacetime symmetries, and discuss the shortcomings of the latter. These RQF conservation laws lead to a deeper understanding of physics in the form of simple, exact, operational definitions of gravitational energy and momentum fluxes, which in turn reveal, for the first time, the exact, detailed mechanisms of gravitational energy and momentum transfer taking place in a wide variety of physical phenomena, including a simple falling apple.

The central physical idea is to focus on on-shell diagrams as objects of fundamental importance to scattering amplitudes. We show that the all-loop integrand in N=4 SYM is naturally represented in this way. On-shell diagrams in this theory are intimately tied to a variety of mathematical objects, ranging from a new graphical representation of permutations to a beautiful stratification of the Grassmannian G(k,n) which generalizes the notion of a simplex in projective space. All physically important operations involving on-shell diagrams map to canonical operations on permutations; in particular, BCFW deformations correspond to adjacent transpositions. Each cell of the positive Grassmannian is naturally endowed with positive coordinates and an invariant measure which determines the on-shell function associated with the diagram. This understanding allows us to classify and compute all on-shell diagrams, and give a geometric understanding for all the non-trivial relations among them. Yangian invariance of scattering amplitudes is transparently represented by diffeomorphisms of G(k,n) which preserve the positive structure. Scattering amplitudes in (1+1)-dimensional integrable systems and the ABJM theory in (2+1) dimensions can both be understood as special cases of these ideas. On-shell diagrams in theories with less (or no) supersymmetry are associated with exactly the same structures in the Grassmannian, but with a measure deformed by a factor encoding ultraviolet singularities.

The conservative dynamics is complicated by extreme perihelion precession compounded by spin-induced precession. We are able to quantitatively define and describe the fully three-dimensional motion of comparable-mass binaries with one black hole spinning and expose an underlying simplicity. To do so, we untangle the dynamics by capturing the motion in the orbital plane and explicitly separate out the precession of the plane itself. Our system is defined by the conservative third-order post-Newtonian Hamiltonian plus spin-orbit coupling for one spinning black hole with a nonspinning companion. Our results are twofold: (1) We derive highly simplified equations of motion in a nonorthogonal orbital basis, and (2) we define a complete taxonomy for fully three-dimensional orbits. More than just a naming system, the taxonomy provides unambiguous and quantitative descriptions of the orbits, including a determination of the zoom-whirliness of any given orbit. Through a correspondence with the rationals, we are able to show that zoom-whirl behavior is prevalent in comparable-mass binaries in the strong-field regime, as it is for extreme-mass-ratio binaries in the strong field. A first significant conclusion that can be drawn from this analysis is that all generic orbits in the final stages of inspiral under gravitational radiation losses are characterized by precessing clovers with few leaves, and that no orbit will behave like the tightly precessing ellipse of Mercury. The gravitational waveform produced by these low-leaf clovers will reflect the natural harmonics of the orbital basis—harmonics that, importantly, depend only on radius.

In addition, each unstable spherical orbit is asymptotically approached by an orbit that whirls an infinite number of times, known as a homoclinic orbit. A homoclinic trajectory is an infinite whirl limit of the zoom-whirl spectrum and has a further significance as the separatrix between inspiral and plunge for eccentric orbits.

Rather the emission domain lies just outside a timelike Marginal Outer Trapped Surface that is locally defined. The emission domain is mainly located inside the event horizon. A spacelike singularity forms behind the event horizon, and most of the Hawking radiation ends up at this singularity rather than at infinity. Whether any Hawking radiation reaches infinity depends on the relation between the emission domain and the event horizon. From the outside view, even if radiation is seen as always being emitted, the black hole never evaporates away, rather its mass and entropy asymptote to finite non-zero limits, and the event horizon always acts as a sink for matter and information.

The description of gravitational waves, and a gravitational wave detector\\'s response, to the unphysical metric perturbation has lead to a proliferation of false analogies and descriptions regarding how these detectors function, and true misunderstandings of the physical character of gravitational waves. Here we provide a fully physical and gauge invariant description of the response of a wide class of gravitational wave detectors in terms of the Riemann curvature, the physical quantity that describes gravitational phenomena in general relativity. In the limit of high frequency gravitational waves, the Riemann curvature separates into two independent gauge invariant quantities: a \"background\" curvature contribution and a \"wave\" curvature contribution. In this limit the gravitational wave contribution to the detector response reduces to an integral of the gravitational wave contribution of the curvature along the unperturbed photon path between components of the detector. The description presented here provides an unambiguous physical description of what a gravitational wave detector measures and how it operates, a simple means of computing corrections to a detectors response owing to general detector motion, a straightforward way of connecting the results of numerical relativity simulations to gravitational wave detection, and a basis for a general and fully relativistic pulsar timing formula.'), (8350, '1310.2871'), (8351, 'Gravitational wave detector response in terms of spacetime Riemann curvature'), (8352, 'http://www.arxiv.org/pdf/1310.2871.pdf'), (8353, '1310.2871 PDF'), (8354, 'http://arxiv.org/abs/1307.6232'), (8355, '2013-10-31 15:50:46'), (8356, \"We describe a general procedure to generate spinning, precessing waveforms that include inspiral, merger and ringdown stages in the effective-one-body (EOB) approach.

The best-fit parameters at low and high mass correspond to natural physical limits: the pre-merger orbit and post-merger perturbed black hole. Our results suggest that physically-motivated synthetic signals can be derived by viewing radiation from suitable nonprecessing binaries in a suitable nonintertial reference frame.

Central to the power of this approach is the way in which the formalism deals with rotations; for example, if we have two arbitrary sets of vectors, known to be related via a 3D rotation, the rotation is easily recoverable if the vectors are given. Extracting the rotation by conventional means is not as straightforward. The calculus associated with geometric algebra is particularly powerful, enabling one, in a very natural way, to take derivatives with respect to any multivector (general element of the algebra). What this means in practice is that we can minimize with respect to rotors representing rotations, vectors representing translations, or any other relevant geometric quantity. This has important implications for many of the least-squares problems in computer vision where one attempts to find optimal rotations, translations etc., given observed vector quantities. We will illustrate this by analysing the problem of estimating motion from a pair of images, looking particularly at the more difficult case in which we have available only 2D information and no information on range.

In a spherical black hole, the river of space falls into the black hole at the Newtonian escape velocity, hitting the speed of light at the horizon. Inside the horizon, the river flows inward faster than light, carrying everything with it. We show that the river model works also for rotating (Kerr-Newman) black holes, though with a surprising twist. As in the spherical case, the river of space can be regarded as moving through a flat background. However, the river does not spiral inward, as one might have anticipated, but rather falls inward with no azimuthal swirl at all. Instead, the river has at each point not only a velocity but also a rotation, or twist. That is, the river has a Lorentz structure, characterized by six numbers (velocity and rotation), not just three (velocity). As an object moves through the river, it changes its velocity and rotation in response to tidal changes in the velocity and twist of the river along its path.

We show that rates as high as hundreds of detections per year, or as low as no detections whatsoever, are both possible. It was thought that the only way to produce these massive binaries was via dynamical interactions in dense stellar systems. This view has been challenged by the recent discovery of several stars with mass greater than 150 Msun in the R136 region of the Large Magellanic Cloud. Current models predict that when stars of this mass leave the main sequence, their expansion is insufficient to allow common envelope evolution to efficiently reduce the orbital separation. The resulting black-hole--black-hole binary remains too wide to be able to coalesce within a Hubble time. If this assessment is correct, isolated very massive binaries do not evolve to be gravitational-wave sources. However, other formation channels exist. For example, the high multiplicity of massive stars, and their common formation in relatively dense stellar associations, opens up dynamical channels for massive black hole mergers (e.g., via Kozai cycles or repeated binary-single interactions).

Even then, the resulting waveforms can in principle be contaminated by gauge effects. In contrast, CCE directly provides, by construction, gauge-invariant waveforms at future null infinity. We verify the gauge invariance of CCE by running the same physical simulation using two different gauge conditions. We find that these two gauge conditions produce the same CCE waveforms but show differences in extrapolated-Ψ4 waveforms. We examine data from several different binary configurations and measure the dominant sources of error in the extrapolated-Ψ4 and CCE waveforms. In some cases, we find that NP waveforms extrapolated to infinity agree with the corresponding CCE waveforms to within the estimated error bars. However, we find that in other cases extrapolated and CCE waveforms disagree, most notably for m=0 “memory” modes.'), (9110, 'Comparing gravitational waveform extrapolation to Cauchy-characteristic extraction in binary black hole simulations'), (9111, 'http://journals.aps.org.proxy.library.cornell.edu/prd/pdf/10.1103/PhysRevD.88.124010'), (9112, 'http://www.jstor.org/stable/2949580'), (9113, 'Copyright © 1970 Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics'), (9114, '1-46'), (9115, '1970-03-01 March 1, 1970'), (9116, '2014-04-04 21:34:39'), (9117, 'When a Hermitian linear operator is slightly perturbed, by how much can its invariant subspaces change?

Here we consider the gravitational wave energy flux at infinity from a point particle in a circular orbit around a Schwarzschild black hole, which is known to 22PN beyond the lowest-order Newtonian prediction, at which point each order has over 1000 terms. We introduce a factorization that considerably simplifies the spherical harmonic modes of the energy flux (and thus also the amplitudes of the spherical harmonic modes of the gravitational waves); it is likely that much of the complexity this factorization removes is due to curved-space wave propagation (e.g., tail effects). For the modes with azimuthal number l of 7 or greater, this factorization reduces the expressions for the modes that enter the 22PN total energy flux to pure integer PN series with rational coefficients, which amounts to a reduction of up to a factor of ~150 in the total number of terms in a given mode. The reduction in complexity becomes less dramatic for smaller l, due to the structure of the expansion, though the factorization is still able to remove all the half-integer PN terms. For the 22PN l = 2 modes, this factorization still reduces the total number of terms (and size) by a factor of ~10 and gives purely rational coefficients through 8PN. This factorization also improves the convergence of the series, though we find the exponential resummation introduced for the full energy flux by Isoyama et al. to be even more effective at improving the convergence of the individual modes, producing improvements of over four orders of magnitude over the original series for some modes. However, the exponential resummation is not as effective at simplifying the series, particularly for the higher-order modes.'), (9133, 'Taming the post-Newtonian expansion: Simplifying the modes of the gravitational wave energy flux at infinity for a point particle in a circular orbit around a Schwarzschild black hole'), (9134, 'Taming the post-Newtonian expansion'), (9135, 'http://www.arxiv.org/pdf/1405.1572.pdf'), (9136, '1405.1572 PDF'), (9137, 'http://arxiv.org/abs/1004.0679'), (9138, '2010-05-00 5/2010'), (9139, 'arXiv:1004.0679 [gr-qc, physics:physics]'), (9140, '10.1103/PhysRevD.81.104012'), (9141, '2014-05-08 18:12:26'), (9142, 'We study systems analogous to binary black holes with spin in order to gain some insight into the origin and nature of \"bobbing\" motion and \"kicks\" that occur in this system.

We first show that bobbing of exactly the type as observed in numerical simulations of the binary black hole system occurs in a simple system consisting of two spinning balls connected by an elastic band in flat spacetime. This bobbing may be understood as arising from the difference between a spinning body\\'s \"lab frame centroid\" and its true center of mass, and is purely \"kinematical\" in the sense that it will appear regardless of the forces holding two spinning bodies in orbit. Next, we develop precise rules for relating the motion of charged bodies in a stationary external electromagnetic field in flat spacetime with the motion of bodies in a weakly curved stationary spacetime. We then consider the system consisting of two orbiting charges with magnetic dipole moment and spin at a level of approximation corresponding to 1.5 post-Newtonian order. Here we find that considerable amounts of momentum are exchanged between the bodies and the electromagnetic field; however, the bodies store this momentum entirely as \"hidden\" mechanical momentum, so that the interchange does not give rise to any net bobbing. The net bobbing that does occur is due solely to the kinematical spin effect, and we therefore argue that the net bobbing of the electromagnetic binary is not associated with possible kicks.

Nevertheless, the linear-momentum flux at higher PN orders can be employed to build more reliable resummed expressions aimed at capturing the nonperturbative effects until merger.

The most effective method to look for a signal with a well understood waveform, such as the binary black hole signal, is matched filtering against a library of model waveforms. While current model waveforms are comprised solely of the dominant radiation mode, the quadrupole mode, it is known that there can be significant power in the higher-order modes for a broad range of physically relevant source parameters during the merger of the black holes. The binary black hole waveforms produced by numerical relativity are accurate through late inspiral, merger, and ringdown and include the higher-order modes. The available numerical-relativity waveforms span an increasing portion of the physical parameter space of unequal mass, spin and precession. In this paper, we investigate the degree to which gravitational-wave searches could be improved by the inclusion of higher modes in the model waveforms, for signals with a variety of initial mass ratios and generic spins. Our investigation studies how well the quadrupole-only waveform model matches the signal as a function of the inclination and orientation of the source and how the modes contribute to the distance reach into the Universe of Advanced LIGO for a fixed set of internal source parameters. The mismatch between signals and quadrupole-only waveforms can be large, dropping below 0.97 for up to 65% of the source sky for the nonprecessing cases we studied, and over a larger area in one precessing case. There is a corresponding 30% increase in detection volume that could be achieved by adding higher modes to the search; however, this is mitigated by the fact that the mismatch is largest for signals which radiate the least energy and to which the search is therefore least sensitive.

The stationary phase approximation (SPA) can be used to compute closed-form frequency-domain waveforms for non-precessing, quasi-circular binary inspirals. However, until now, no fast frequency-domain waveforms have existed for generic, spin-precessing quasi-circular compact binary inspirals. Templates for these systems have had to be computed via a discrete Fourier transform of finely sampled time-domain waveforms, which is far more computationally expensive than those constructed directly in the frequency-domain, especially for those systems that are dominated by the inspiral part. There are two obstacles to deriving frequency-domain waveforms for precessing systems: (i) the spin-precession equations do not admit closed-form solutions for generic systems; (ii) the SPA fails catastrophically. Presently there is no general solution to the first problem, so we must resort to numerical integration of the spin precession equations. This is not a significant obstacle, as numerical integration on the slow precession timescale adds very little to the computational cost of generating the waveforms. Our main result is to solve the second problem, by providing an alternative to the SPA that we call the method of Shifted Uniform Asymptotics, or SUA, that cures the divergences in the SPA. The construction of frequency-domain templates using the SUA can be orders of magnitude more efficient than the time-domain ones obtained through a discrete Fourier transform.

In this review, we discuss current mass and spin measurements and their reliability for neutron stars and stellar-mass black holes, as well as the overall importance of spins and masses for compact object astrophysics. Current masses are obtained primarily through electromagnetic observations of binaries, although future microlensing observations promise to enhance our understanding substantially. The spins of neutron stars are straightforward to measure for pulsars, but the birth spins of neutron stars are more difficult to determine. In contrast, even the current spins of stellar-mass black holes are challenging to measure. As we discuss, major inroads have been made in black hole spin estimates via analysis of iron lines and continuum emission, with reasonable agreement when both types of estimate are possible for individual objects, and future X-ray polarization measurements may provide additional independent information.

The most prominent of these is a parity-violating asymmetry that beams energy and linear momentum preferentially along or opposite to the orbital angular momentum, leading to recoil of the binary. The asymmetry will appear as amplitude and phase modulations at the orbital frequency. For strongly precessing systems, it accounts for at least 3% amplitude modulation for binaries in the sensitivity band of ground-based gravitational-wave detectors, and can exceed 50% for massive systems. Such asymmetric features are also clearly visible when the waves are decomposed into modes of spin-weighted spherical harmonics, and are inherent in the waves themselves---rather than resulting from residual eccentricity in numerical simulations, or from mode-mixing due to precession. In particular, there is generically no instantaneous frame for which the mode decomposition will have any symmetry. We introduce a method to simplify the expressions for waveforms given in analytical relativity, which can be used to combine existing high-order waveforms for nonprecessing systems with expressions for the precessing contributions, leading to improved accuracy and a unified treatment of precessing and nonprecessing binaries. Using this method, it is possible to clarify the nature and the origins of the asymmetries and show the effects of asymmetry on recoils more clearly. We present post-Newtonian (PN) expressions for the waveform modes that include these terms, complete to the relative 2PN level in spin (proportional to $v^4/c^4$ times a certain combination of the spins).

We report here on the results of the second NINJA project, NINJA-2, which employs 60 complete BBH hybrid waveforms consisting of a numerical portion modelling the late inspiral, merger, and ringdown stitched to a post-Newtonian portion modelling the early inspiral. In a ‘blind injection challenge’ similar to that conducted in recent Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory (LIGO) and Virgo science runs, we added seven hybrid waveforms to two months of data recoloured to predictions of Advanced LIGO (aLIGO) and Advanced Virgo (AdV) sensitivity curves during their first observing runs. The resulting data was analysed by GW detection algorithms and 6 of the waveforms were recovered with false alarm rates smaller than 1 in a thousand years. Parameter-estimation algorithms were run on each of these waveforms to explore the ability to constrain the masses, component angular momenta and sky position of these waveforms. We find that the strong degeneracy between the mass ratio and the BHs’ angular momenta will make it difficult to precisely estimate these parameters with aLIGO and AdV. We also perform a large-scale Monte Carlo study to assess the ability to recover each of the 60 hybrid waveforms with early aLIGO and AdV sensitivity curves.

Consequently, the nonconservative aspects of a physical system are derived solely from $K$. We show how to use the formalism with examples of nonconservative actions for discrete systems including forced damped harmonic oscillators, radiation reaction on an accelerated charge, and RLC circuits. We present examples for nonconservative classical field theories. Our approach naturally allows for irreversible thermodynamic processes to be included in an unconstrained variational principle.

These sophisticated tools provide powerful machinery for describing the physical world, however, their physical interpretation is often not intuitive.

Prof. Tisza revisits many elementary problems with an advanced treatment in order to help develop the geometrical intuition for the algebraic machinery that may carry over to more advanced problems.\\n\\nThe lecture notes came to MIT OpenCourseWare by way of Samuel Gasster, \\'77 (Course 18), who had taken the course and kept a copy of the lecture notes for his own reference.

In contrast to “clean” black holes, however, the late time tail contains small amplitude wiggles with the frequency of the dominating quasibound state. Additionally, an observer dependent beating pattern may also be seen. These features were already observed in fully nonlinear studies; our analysis shows they are present at linear level, and, since it reduces to a 1+1 dimensional numerical problem, allows for cleaner numerical data. Moreover, we discuss the power law of the tail and that it only becomes universal sufficiently far away from the dirty black hole.

The scalar field on the surface of the star must vary as a1+a2exp(−t2M) due to time dilation. An analysis is presented of the evolution of the exterior scalar field, based on a simple wave equation containing a space-time-curvature-induced potential barrier. This barrier is shown to be impenetrable to zero-frequency waves and thus a1, the final value of the field on the surface of the star, is not manifested in the exterior; the exterior field vanishes. The detailed nature of the falloff of the field depends on backscattering off the potential. It is shown that an initially static l pole dies out as t−(2l+2). If there is no initial l pole but one develops during the collapse it must fall off as t−(2l+3). Wave equations with curvature-induced potential barriers have been derived by Regge and Wheeler and by Zerilli for gravitational perturbations. With these equations the analysis of gravitational perturbations is precisely the same as for the scalar ones. In particular, gravitational multipole perturbations (with l≥2) fall off at large t as t−(2l+2) or t−(2l+3), depending on initial conditions.

The dynamics in the complementary 1+1 Lorentzian spacetime is followed by making use of a fourth-order finite differencing scheme. In handling the pertinent 1+1 transverse degrees of freedom, the techniques of adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) is also applied. In checking the reliability and effectiveness of the introduced new method, the evolution of a massless scalar field on a fixed Kerr spacetime is investigated. In particular, the angular distribution of the evolving field in superradiant scattering is studied. The primary aim was to check the validity of some of the recent arguments claiming that the Penrose process, or its field theoretical correspondence—superradiance—does play a crucial role in jet formation in black hole spacetimes while matter accretes onto the central object. Our findings appear to be contrary to these claims as the angular dependence of superradiant scattering of massless scalar fields does not show any preference of the axis of rotation. In addition, the characteristic properties of superradiance in the case of a massless scalar field were also investigated. Contrary to the general expectations, we found that by an incident wave packet, which had been tuned to be maximally superradiant, the acquired extra energy in the scattering process must be less than 0.1% of the energy sent in. It was found that instead of the occurrence of an anticipated scale of energy extraction from black hole, the to be superradiant part of the incident wave packet fails to reach the ergoregion; rather it suffers a nearly perfect reflection which appears to be an interesting phenomenon.'), (10505, 'On the use of multipole expansion in time evolution of nonlinear dynamical systems and some surprises related to superradiance'), (10506, '2015-04-16 16:43:58'), (10507, '0264-9381_30_1_015010.pdf'), (10508, 'http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.06120'), (10509, 'arXiv:1502.06120 [gr-qc, physics:hep-th]'), (10510, '2015-02-21 2015-02-21'), (10511, 'arXiv: 1502.06120'), (10512, '2015-04-15 18:26:17'), (10513, \"The conventional gravitational memory effect is a relative displacement in the position of two detectors induced by radiative energy flux.

The initial-value problem is considered for source fields with both compact and extended radial dependences, and the problem of the formal divergence of the integrals of extended sources over quasinormal-mode wave functions is solved. The branch-cut integral produces a weak late-time radiative power-law decay tail that will characterize the astrophysically observed radiation spectrum for times subsequent to the exponential decay of the quasinormal ringing, when (ct-r*)≫2MG/c2 and (ct-r*)/r*≪1. This radiative decay tail is shown to diminish to Price’s nonradiative tail in the final limit ct/r*≫1. The method is applied to a characteristic-value problem used to model the gravitational collapse of massive stars, and to the small-body radial in-fall problem.

Algebraic properties of the rotation and boost generators then give simple, exact recursion relations that allow us to raise or lower the multipole quantum numbers ℓ and m and the spin weight s. Further recursion relations express kernels of other Doppler weights d≠1 in terms of the d=1 kernels.

In this work we describe a numerical method for removing Lorentz-boost effects from real-space temperature maps. We show that to deboost a map so that one can accurately extract the temperature power spectrum requires calculating the boost kernel at a finer pixelization than one might naively expect. In idealized cases that allow for easy comparison to analytic results, we have confirmed that there is indeed mode mixing among the spherical harmonic coefficients of the temperature. We find that using a boost kernel calculated at Nside = 8192 leads to a 1 per cent bias in the binned boosted power spectrum at ℓ ∼ 2000, while individual Cℓs exhibit ∼5 per cent fluctuations around the binned average. However, this bias is dominated by pixelization effects and not the aberration and Doppler shift of CMB photons that causes the fluctuations. Performing analysis on maps with Galactic cuts does not induce any additional error in the boosted, binned power spectra over the full sky analysis. For multipoles that are free of resolution effects, there is no detectable deviation between the binned boosted and unboosted spectra. This result arises because the power spectrum is a slowly varying function of ℓ and does not show that, in general, Lorentz boosts can be neglected for other cosmological quantities such as polarization maps or higher point functions.\"), (10855, 'Real-space approach to cosmic microwave background deboosting'), (10856, 'http://mnras.oxfordjournals.org.proxy.library.cornell.edu/content/432/3/2208.full.pdf'), (10857, 'http://arxiv.org/abs/1009.4937'), (10858, 'arXiv:1009.4937 [astro-ph]'), (10859, 'arXiv: 1009.4937'), (10860, '2015-05-04 17:57:18'), (10861, \"The largest fluctuation in the observed CMB temperature field is the dipole, its origin being usually attributed to the Doppler Effect - the Earth's velocity with respect to the CMB rest frame.

It is well known that on the largest angular scales the combined effects of Doppler shifts and aberration are important; the lowest Legendre multipoles of total intensity receive power from the large CMB monopole in transforming from the CMB frame. On small angular scales aberration dominates and is shown here to lead to significant distortions of the total intensity and polarization multipoles in transforming from the rest frame of the CMB to the frame of the solar system. We provide convenient analytic results for the distortions as series expansions in the relative velocity of the two frames, but at the highest resolutions a numerical quadrature is required. Although many of the high resolution multipoles themselves are severely distorted by the frame transformations, we show that their statistical properties distort by only an insignificant amount.

We propose to measure independently our local motion by using off-diagonal two-point correlation functions for high multipoles. We study the observability of the signal for temperature and polarization anisotropies. We point out that Planck can measure the velocity β with an error of about 30% and the direction with an error of about 20°. This method constitutes a cross-check, which can be useful to verify that our CMB dipole is due mainly to our velocity or to disentangle the velocity from other possible intrinsic sources.
