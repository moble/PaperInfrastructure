The particular algebras are distinguished by the choice of a pseudoscalar, which incorporates all vectors within that particular algebra.
Certainly, this is a sensible approach, but I don't think they made it clear.  And it certainly could be confusing to anyone who approaches the book having already seen GA in other contexts (where it is almost always defined more constructively).
In particular, I think this book would make a very poor introduction to the subject, though it certainly has many good points.}
